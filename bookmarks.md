## @karpathy - Building Open Source Communities Like Bacteria
> How to build a thriving open source community by writing code like bacteria do 🦠. Bacterial code (genomes) are:
>
> - small (each line of code costs energy)
> - modular (organized into groups of swappable operons)
> - self-contained (easily "copy paste-able" via horizontal gene transfer)
>
> If chunks of code are small, modular, self-contained and trivial to copy-and-paste, the community can thrive via horizontal gene transfer. For any function (gene) or class (operon) that you write: can you imagine someone going "yoink" without knowing the rest of your code or having to import anything new, to gain a benefit? Could your code be a trending GitHub gist?
>
> This coding style guide has allowed bacteria to colonize every ecological nook from cold to hot to acidic or alkaline in the depths of the Earth and the vacuum of space, along with an insane diversity of carbon anabolism, energy metabolism, etc. It excels at rapid prototyping but... it can't build complex life. By comparison, the eukaryotic genome is a significantly larger, more complex, organized and coupled monorepo. Significantly less inventive but necessary for complex life - for building entire organs and coordinating their activity. With our advantage of intelligent design, it should possible to take advantage of both. Build a eukaryotic monorepo backbone if you have to, but maximize bacterial DNA.

## @_avichawla - Strix AI Pentesting Framework
> Pentesting firms don't want you to see this.
>
> An open-source AI agent just replicated their $50k service.
>
> A "normal" pentest today looks like this:
>
> - $20k-$50k per engagement
> - 4-6 weeks of scoping, NDAs, kickoff calls
> - A big PDF that's outdated the moment you ship a new feature
>
> Meanwhile, AI agents are quietly starting to perform on-par with human pentester on the stuff that actually matters day-to-day:
>
> ⤳ Enumerating attack surface
> ⤳ Fuzzing endpoints
> ⤳ Chaining simple vulns into real impact
> ⤳ Producing PoCs and remediation steps developers can actually use
>
> And they do it in hours instead of weeks and at a fraction of the cost.
>
> This approach is actually implemented in Strix, a recently-trending open-source framework (14k+ stars) for AI pentesting agent.
>
> The framework spins up a team of AI "attackers" that probe your web apps, APIs, and code.
>
> It then returns validated findings with exploit evidence, remediation steps, and a full PDF report that looks exactly like what you'd get from a traditional firm, but without a $50k invoice and a month-long wait time.
>
> You can see the full implementation on GitHub and try it yourself.
>
> Just run: `strix --target https://your-app.com` and you are good to go.
>
> Human red teams aren't disappearing but the routine pentest (pre-launch, post-refactor, quarterly checks) is clearly shifting to AI.
>
> Strix is one of the first tools that makes that shift feel real instead of hypothetical.
>
> I've shared the GitHub repo in the replies.

## @mitchellh - Ghostty Vim Mode Implementation

> Here's a short video (4m) that goes into more detail on how "vim mode" works in Ghostty and the multitude of features that are composed together to make it all work. This showcases how powerful Ghostty's keybinding system is getting!
>
> And don't worry, I plan on shipping a built-in "vim mode" table (unbound by default) so you can bind an opinionated "vim mode" with a single line in your config. But, if you want to modify it in any way, that's completely possible because this all works via standard config.
