## @karpathy - Think of LLMs as Simulators, Not Entities with Thoughts

> Don't think of LLMs as entities but as simulators. For example, when exploring a topic, don't ask:
>
> "What do you think about xyz"?
>
> There is no "you". The LLM can channel/simulate many perspectives but it hasn't "thought about" xyz for a while and formed its own opinions. If you force it via the use of "you", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1997731268969304070
- **Tags:** AI
- **What:** Andrej Karpathy clarifies the conceptual distinction between LLMs as simulators vs. entities with agency. Recommends reframing prompts from "What do you think?" to "What would X experts say?" to access the LLM's actual capability to simulate perspectives rather than a mystical "opinion" borrowed from finetuning statistics.

## @Teslarati - Tesla FSD Follow Mode Feature Request (Quote Tweet)

> Hey @elonmusk, do you think we could get a "Follow Mode," where you can still use FSD but follow a car when you're going to the same destination?
>
> *Quoting original FSD v14.2.2 review:* One thing I noticed today that would be a great feature would be to follow a car. I followed my parents home after meeting them and there wasn't a Speed Profile that allowed me to keep up. It either wanted to pass them or would not keep up. A follow mode would be a great touch if it could be refined.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/Teslarati/status/2003890878939877872
- **Quoted:** https://x.com/Teslarati/status/2003696090491634124
- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Feature request for Tesla's Full Self-Driving: a "Follow Mode" that maintains safe distance behind another vehicle when heading to the same destination. Based on user experiences with FSD v14.2.2 where existing speed profiles either wanted to overtake or couldn't maintain pace with a lead vehicle, this addresses a real user need for convoy-like driving scenarios.

## @farzyness - Tesla Cybercab Hidden as Unsupervised FSD Sub-$30k Hatchback Strategy

> Using Cybercab to hide a sub $30k Tesla that has unsupervised FSD + steering wheel and pedals will go down as one of the greatest misdirections of all time.
>
> "Hey yeah so that Cybercab thing, we actually started building them and we're using them in Austin and other places, but we're actually at a point that we can make way more of them than places we can put them in because of places not letting us operate without a steering wheel and pedal...
>
> So yeah here's one with a steering wheel and pedal for $29k. Oh and it can drive itself without you having to pay attention. You can also do this monthly thing where you pay like $500 a month and payment, insurance, maintenance, charging, self-driving is included."

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/farzyness/status/2001897713097380300
- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Analysis of Tesla's Cybercab strategy as a brilliant product positioning move. Rather than just launching the autonomous Cybercab, Elon introduced a hybrid sub-$30k hatchback with unsupervised FSD + steering wheel/pedals as a regulatory workaround. Includes monthly subscription model ($500/mo all-inclusive: payment, insurance, maintenance, charging, FSD) for jurisdictions that don't allow autonomous operation. Framed as unexpected product launch strategy that catches the market off-guard.

## @pbeisel - Optimus: AI's Killer App and the Future of Embodied Intelligence

> Tesla's AI team has been grinding for years on one of the hardest technical problems of our time: vehicle autonomy. It's the little team that could— while everyone else chased prestige, giant paychecks, and the chance to bask in the presence of the supposed "AI gods" at the likes of Google and Meta, this group stayed focused and solved autonomy the unglamorous way: pixel by pixel, version by version.
>
> But what they've built isn't just for driving. It's the foundation for Optimus.
>
> Embodied AI is that next interface. It is the interface of AI.
>
> A humanoid robot, Optimus, will be the breakthrough. A natural voice interface, a physical human-like presence, and the ability to manipulate the real world as we do. It's AI you don't just talk to; it's AI that does things. This will be how most people on Earth interact with artificial intelligence: not through a screen, but through a physical assistant that feels as natural as interacting with another person.
>
> This is the killer app of AI.

## @PTrubey - Tesla's Optimus Vision Strategy: Avoiding Lidar Crutches

> Tesla is in another "lidar vs vision" debate, this time with their Optimus bot. Tesla infamously doesn't use lidar for vehicle self driving, something the chattering classes used as a rhetorical weapon against it.
>
> Two bot companies (Figure, Sunday) have palm cameras, but Tesla doesn't and won't.
>
> It's the same philosophy as to why they didn't use lidar. The eventual end goal is low cost, so eliminate anything that isn't ABSOLUTELY necessary. Using a palm camera will speed up training, but it's also a crutch that defers tackling harder problems that you'll eventually want to solve anyway. Finally, humans don't need palm cameras.
>
> Tesla will be vindicated with their vehicle self driving decision, and will also likely be vindicated with this one too. It may slow down Tesla's production launch, but they'll end up with an inexpensive, high volume solution that reliably works in more situations.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/PTrubey/status/1996999238929297508
- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Analysis of Tesla's strategic decision to avoid lidar (and palm cameras for humanoid robots) in favor of pure vision systems. Argues this constrains-based approach, while slower, avoids technical debt and produces more generalizable, cost-effective solutions that match human-level perception requirements.

## @cybrtrkguy - FSD 14.2 Winter Driving Performance Review

> FSD 14.2 STUNS IN WINTER DRIVING!
>
> Just got done driving ~100 miles on a snowy interstate and a little suburban driving. A few notes:
>
> FSD absolutely, definitively detects snow as a separate substance from rain.
>
> As the snow began to fall, there came a point where FSD first detected the snow and immediately slowed. From then on, it drove in a *completely different profile*.
>
> Generally, V14.2 kept 40-55mph on a 70mph interstate.
>
> When driving in Sloth/Chill and you try to increase the speed profile to Standard/Hurry, the truck displays a red error saying inclement weather is preventing FSD from speeding up. Fantastic!
>
> V14.2 takes corners slow as molasses to keep traction.
>
> It does NOT shoot gaps and pull out in front of other vehicles. V14.2 waits for BIG gaps to make its merge into traffic. It is properly cautious!
>
> One instance of Red Hands occurred when it was merging into a center left turn lane. This center lane was the only lane not plowed, so either 1. it got confused with lane markings or 2. Slid sideways very slightly and got upset.
>
> On straightaways on the interstate in areas with little snow coverage, V14.2 would speed up close to the speed limit. While the roads were wet today from road treatment, I was concerned for slick & frozen areas and manually backed off on the speed. While not technically unsafe, I did this out of an abundance of caution. IMO this is a grey area between "driving safely" and "not driving how I do" lol
>
> Not much ice today. Just snow and slush.
>
> ***Tonight, 6-12 inches of fresh snow is forecasted to fall here. I'll be out at dawn tomorrow to test in worse conditions with less traffic.***

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/cybrtrkguy/status/1994901956318445831
- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Detailed empirical testing of FSD 14.2 in winter conditions.

## @PhilWhittlesee - Tesla FSD Grok Navigation Route Optimization

> I had a doctor appointment, and was using the navigation and full-self-driving feature to get me there. It is off one of the main streets in the town, but from the direction I'm coming it is impossible to turn into the parking lot due to a concrete median. So, annoyingly, the navigation software always mandates a U-turn.
>
> The most recent update, the 2025 Christmas update, integrated Grok into the navigation system, and you can use Grok voice prompts to adjust your route, add or remove stops, etc. I decided to give that a try.
>
> So I pull up Grok and ask it if can see my destination and route. It confirms that it can, gives me the address, etc. I ask if it can see the U-turn programmed in, and it confirms it with the intersection. I ask it to convert that u-turn to a left-hand-turn instead, and then to proceed about half a block, and then add a new left turn, which will take me into the parking lot via an alternate method.
>
> Easy. Grok does it. Says it has done it. Asks if it looks correct on the screen. The screen zooms in to show the new route in that area. It looks perfect. I say, "Yep, that looks good, execute that." And when we get there, it does!
>
> Coolest damn thing I've seen an AI do. The car drove itself, the AI accessed the data, adjusted the route based on my descriptions and satellite images, and then the car executed it. That is true, agentic AI functioning in my Model Y.
>
> The future is going to be amazing. And every other car manufacturer is in HUGE trouble.

## @BStarr119 - FSD 14.2.1 Cybertruck Advanced Maneuver Execution

> So much to unpack in this one!
>
> FSD just predicted the future and I'm still processing it. Semi in front doing 58, middle lane crawling, overtake lane packed… I'm thinking "welp we're stuck" Mad Max measures closing rates of literally every car around us, sees a pocket forming in the right lane that doesn't even exist yet, dives under the semi (undertake), waits half a beat for the Ram to clear, then slots perfectly into the middle. Zero input from me. It literally calculated relative velocities better than my brain could. 14.2.1 on Cybertruck is straight up psychic now. All-Sight app got the whole magic trick frame-by-frame.

- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Brandon Starship documents an advanced FSD maneuver on Cybertruck v14.2.1. The system performed a complex lane change: identified a future gap in traffic (that didn't yet exist), executed an undertake (passing on the right), timed the maneuver to avoid a Ram truck, and seamlessly merged into the middle lane—all without driver input. System demonstrated predictive velocity calculation superior to human reaction. Recorded with All-Sight app for detailed analysis.

## @karpathy - Agency Over Intelligence: The Underappreciated Competitive Advantage

> *Quoting @garrytan:* Intelligence is on tap now so agency is even more important
>
> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984
- **Quoted:** @garrytan https://x.com/garrytan/status/1894063324582625732
- **Tags:** AI
- **What:** Karpathy argues that agency—the capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and shape one's environment—is more powerful and more valuable than raw intelligence in the AI era. He reflects that he misunderstood this dynamic for decades, influenced by cultural reverence for IQ. With intelligence now commoditized ("on tap"), agency becomes the scarce differentiator. He challenges organizations: Are we hiring for agency? Teaching for agency? This reframes talent and skill development around proactive execution and initiative rather than problem-solving intelligence.

## @karpathy - The Seismic Shift in Programming: Agency and the New Abstraction Layer

> I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521
- **Tags:** AI
- **What:** Andrej Karpathy reflects on feeling profoundly behind in the post-AI era of programming. He describes a fundamental restructuring of the profession where traditional coding contributes increasingly fewer "bits" while a new abstraction layer has emerged involving agents, prompts, MCP, LLMs, and more. The challenge is mastering this new programmable layer while understanding the constraints of stochastic AI systems. He positions this as a skill issue—developers need to mentally model and combine the new AI primitives and tools to unlock 10X productivity gains, but there's no manual for this "alien tool" that's reshaping engineering.
