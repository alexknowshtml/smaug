## @satyanadella - Microsoft Quantum Computing Breakthrough with Majorana 1

> A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...
>
> Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.
>
> After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we've created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.
>
> It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.
>
> We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.
>
> The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller.
>
> They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor.
>
> Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not!

- **What:** Satya Nadella announces Microsoft's major quantum computing breakthrough. After 20 years of research, they've created a new state of matter using topoconductors, enabling Majorana 1—the first quantum processor built on a topological core. The breakthrough promises quantum computers in years rather than decades. Topological qubits are faster, more reliable, and smaller (1/100th of a millimeter), with a clear path to million-qubit processors that could fit in your hand yet solve intractable problems.

## @DavidDeutschOxf - Quantum Theory Research Obsolescence

> Exactly. I was flabbergasted when I saw this result. It renders obsolete a substantial proportion of all past research in the foundations of quantum theory. Bizarrely, some of that research is still happening regardless.

Quoted tweet from @PaulRRobichaud: "It took me years of my life to formally prove this little sentence. To the uninitiated, the statement is obviously true. To an orthodox quantum physicist, it is oblivious false. To those who understand the underlying mathematics, it is simply beautiful."

## @_The_Prophet__ - The 2026 Debt Wall Strengthens Bitcoin

> A debt maturity wall for a sovereign issuer is not a crash signal. It is a currency-debasement signal.

- **Quoted:** https://x.com/NoLimitGains/status/1998930422734967045
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Detailed macroeconomic rebuttal arguing that the 2026 U.S. Treasury debt maturity wall (~$7-8 trillion) is not a funding crisis but rather a structural feature of sovereign debt mechanics.

## @dgt10011 - Institutional Investment Perspective on MicroStrategy STRK Preferred Stock

> As someone who has pitched Bitcoin for nearly a decade, let me make one thing clear from an institutional investment manager's perspective: Bitcoin has never been about the yield.
>
> Think about it. This week, you had the choice between the MSTR preferred at 8% or the JPM preferred at 6.5%. Do you really believe that taking on career risk for a 1.5% spread is justified—especially when you factor in the 60% vs. 20% volatility difference? The tail-risk spread between BTC and JPM is not 1.5%.
>
> That's why JPM raised $3 billion yesterday while $MSTR placed just ~$550 million. Frankly, I'm surprised there was even that much demand, given that the incentives were never aligned. Anyone who has pitched BTC to their in-house Investment Committees knows this.
>
> That said, you—the reader—are likely not managing third-party client capital. That's your edge. You have the privilege to exploit this arbitrage. I called $STRK a "near-perfect" instrument. Overnight, it became perfect. Take advantage of it. Saylor just handed you a gift.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/dgt10011/status/1885344231218397495
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Deep institutional analysis of MicroStrategy's STRK offering dynamics. Jeff Park, pitching Bitcoin for a decade, compares the MSTR preferred (8% yield) vs. JPM preferred (6.5%) from institutional risk perspective. Argues the 1.5% yield spread is insufficient compensation given 60% vs 20% volatility difference and tail-risk exposure to Bitcoin. Notes JPM raised $3B while MSTR placed ~$550M, indicating weak institutional demand when framed through traditional capital allocation frameworks. However, argues individual investors (not managing third-party capital) have unique arbitrage opportunity to exploit STRK as "near-perfect" instrument for Bitcoin exposure with preferred equity protection—essentially a gift from Saylor to retail investors willing to take career risk that institutional managers won't.

## @_The_Prophet__ - Satoshi Nakamoto Identity: Myth Over Man

Satoshi was a memetic veil placed over a network of high-context cryptographers, economists, and dissidents...Bitcoin needed a god that disappeared. Not a founder. A ghost. A myth. A principle beyond ego...Satoshi Nakamoto is the first engineered myth of the digital age. He was real enough to write the code. He was disciplined enough to vanish.

## @TheRealPlanC - Bitcoin Long-Term Adoption vs Explosive Cycles

> What if the earlier "Bitcoin cycles" were nothing more than the product of a retail-dominated, FOMO-fueled market?
>
> What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations?
>
> And every time we enter one of these consolidations, people selling think the cycle is over and that Bitcoin will drop 50–80% so they can buy back in lower—but it never does.
>
> Instead, we just keep grinding slowly upward to $1,000,000 over the next seven years in a very boring and underwhelming way, as Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance and adoption from the traditional financial system and major players.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/TheRealPlanC/status/1962181012789613046
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Plan C challenges the conventional narrative of explosive Bitcoin market cycles. Proposes an alternative future where Bitcoin transitions from retail FOMO-driven volatility to institutional-led adoption, characterized by slow, steady appreciation with modest corrections. Projects a path to $1M over seven years through boring, predictable consolidations rather than dramatic boom-bust cycles. Reflects the shift in market dynamics as Bitcoin gains acceptance from traditional finance and institutional players.

The timeline sequence—from Federal Reserve obsolescence through transformation of payments, economic theory, real estate valuations, and wealth redistribution—positions Bitcoin victory as a revolutionary paradigm shift. "Money printer runs out of toner" metaphorically represents the end of fiat currency expansion. Final chapter pivots to building new systems in a Bitcoin-native world.

## @TradersMastery - Bitcoin Evolution from Speculation to Institutional Adoption

> Two potential paths for Bitcoin nobody I know of has presented. Both rooted in long-term compounding math, together I estimate with greater than 80% probability of playing out.
>
> Both paths ultimately respect the same long-term log regression the difference is whether this cycle produces one final blow-off (which comes much later in the cycle than believed) or Bitcoin is already evolving into a "steady grind" mega-asset.
>
> Base case (60–65% probability):
> Path 1 (grind within channel).
>
> Bitcoin is transitioning from early adopter → early majority phase.
>
> Historically, assets entering institutional adoption see dampened volatility. The emergence of ETFs and global liquidity flows suggest a "smoother curve" rather than massive blow-offs every 4 years.
>
> If Bitcoin is truly leaving the "early speculative phase" and entering monetary adoption, this is the most likely path ahead.
>
> There are two more paths that need to be shared for this conversation.

- **What:** Jordan Lindsey outlines probabilistic framework for Bitcoin's market evolution with 80%+ confidence. Identifies the S-curve transition from early-adopter to early-majority phase as key inflection point. Contrasts two primary scenarios: (1) final blow-off happening later in cycle than expected, (2) transition to institutional "steady grind" mega-asset with reduced volatility. References the dampening effect of ETF accessibility and institutional liquidity on cycle volatility. Supports the boring Bitcoin thesis while acknowledging explosive upside remains possible.

The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.
>
> The banned Brabham BT46B "fan car" which was driven by Niki Lauda was effective due to its innovative fan system, which generated massive downforce by creating a low-pressure area beneath the car, allowing superior cornering grip at all speeds, unlike conventional aerodynamics that relied on speed for downforce. The drivers said it felt like a vacuum cleaner suction. It was banned after one race.

Documents $19-20B in liquidations across the market: ATOM ($4.00→$0.001, 99.97% loss), SUI ($3.40→$0.56, 83.5%), APT ($5.00→$0.75, 85%), SEI ($0.28→$0.07, 75%), LINK ($22→$8, 63.6%), ADA ($0.80→$0.30, 62.5%)—all within minutes, not hours. While Bitcoin dropped 10% (normal volatility), "blue chip" institutional-grade projects were destroyed. Argues that the diversification narrative was "wrecked," the "altcoin season" narrative was "exposed," and the "blue chip portfolio" advice proved "worthless." Concludes: all altcoins—regardless of technology or VC backing—are leveraged beta on Bitcoin with 80% downside risk. The market demonstrated that when systemic stress occurs, only Bitcoin survives as the sole genuinely valuable asset.

- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Personal testimony on Tesla's Full Self-Driving capabilities as of May 2025: testing globally, in daily use in USA, demonstrating smoothness and consistency superior to human drivers. Notes dramatic improvements over the past year with no signs of slowdown. Most drives require only single button tap; disengagement needed only for parking. Acknowledges rough edges remain but argues trajectory makes resolution inevitable. Critiques continued skepticism despite "reality screaming in their faces," attributing disbelief to psychological resistance to paradigm shifts. Prophetic thesis: by 2035, autonomous driving will be so obviously transformative that skeptics will wonder why they didn't see it coming.

## @_The_Prophet__ - Unit-of-Account Fracture and Currency Regime Shift

> ⚡️What you're really seeing here is the first stage of a global unit-of-account fracture.
>
> •In nominal USD terms, everything looks like it's booming: stocks up triple digits, homes up double digits, "wealth" everywhere. That's the performance everyone sees.
>
> •In gold terms, the illusion cracks: stocks and homes flat-to-negative, real wealth stagnating.
>
> •In Bitcoin terms, the veil is gone: catastrophic real losses in every traditional asset.

- **Quoted:** https://x.com/LukeGromen/status/1974184554782220583
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** SightBringer argues that nominal USD asset gains mask catastrophic real wealth losses when measured in gold or Bitcoin. Characterizes current state as "unit-of-account transition phase"—the final stage of imperial carry trade where the U.S. draws global capital, inflates nominal asset prices, and exports currency risk abroad. Uses "debasement trade" framing: NDX +165% USD, +7% gold, -78% BTC; SPX +102% USD, -18% gold, -84% BTC; real estate +56% USD, -37% gold, -87% BTC since COVID. Interprets Bitcoin's rise not as volatility but as parallel reserve ledger functioning as the only denominator showing the post-2020 economy's true condition (Argentina-like trajectory). Warns that USD is the "dying denominator" and most wealth is positioned in the wrong yardstick for incoming regime change.

## @ElonTrades - October 11 Crypto Crash: Binance Design Flaw Exploitation

> The Oct 11 Crypto Crash — What Really Happened
>
> TL;DR:
>
> Roughly $60–90M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance's own order-book data instead of external oracles.
>
> That localized depeg triggered $500M–$1B in forced liquidations, cascaded into $19B+ globally, and earned the attackers about $192M via $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts opened on Hyperliquid hours earlier, but minutes before Trump tariff announcement.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/ElonTrades/status/1977340254047649966
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** ElonTrades provides forensic analysis of the October 2025 crypto crash: sophisticated actors exploited Binance's collateral pricing vulnerability ($60-90M USDe dump driving internal depeg to $0.65), triggering $500M-$1B in margin liquidations. Meanwhile, coordinated actors opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts on Hyperliquid using $110M USDC from Arbitrum, profiting $192M as cascading liquidations and Trump tariff panic crashed prices. Claims $19B+ in global liquidations resulted from <$100M of collateral manipulation timed with macro shock. Root cause: Binance's internal order-book pricing instead of oracle-based collateral valuation (not a USDe failure). Binance admitted "platform-related issues," compensated affected users, and rolled out oracle integration. Notes USDe remained 1:1 collateralized and operational—incident is case study in exchange-side pricing errors triggering systemic liquidations.

## @SawyerMerritt - Waymo Scaling Laws Paper Validates Tesla's Approach

> Current head of compute at Anthropic, Corry Wang:
>
> "I don't think people have realized how much this new Waymo scaling laws paper is basically an admission that "Waymo was wrong, @Tesla was right: In contrast to Waymo, it's clear Tesla has now internalized the bitter lesson. They threw out their legacy AV software stack a few years ago, built a 10x larger training GPU cluster than Waymo, and have 1000x more cars on the road collecting training data today."

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1935770259140624475
- **Tags:** Tesla
- **What:** Corry Wang (Anthropic compute lead) provides technical analysis of Waymo's recent scaling laws paper as vindication of Tesla's autonomous driving strategy. Core argument: Waymo clung to legacy software architecture while Tesla discarded it, built massive training infrastructure (10x larger GPU clusters), and collected 1000x more real-world training data. Waymo's paper essentially admits this architectural difference was decisive—Tesla internalized the "bitter lesson" (that scale and data quality trump algorithmic sophistication) while Waymo didn't until now.

## @BitPaine - Wall Street Patient Capital vs. Early Crypto Scammers: The Long Game

> I will look back for the tweet and post below but this has been my thesis for some time:
>
> Wall Street is patient, smart money.
>
> Most early crypto investors are dumb money that got lucky, and became accustomed to a pattern of BTC pumps -> alt season -> crash.
>
> (If this wasn't obvious it should be now as many OG cryptoscammer types show off their evidently two-digit IQs pumping ZCash of all things).
>
> These unethical goons had enough bitcoin from being early that they could sell into the BTC pumps, buy small cap alts, dump on retail at the peak, and buy back bitcoin on the crash. Ostensibly, although at not insignificant risk, increasing their BTC stash. This was all readily coordinated off the books in signal chats, telegram groups and such, and became increasingly manipulated by large "crypto hedge funds" (3AC) and fraudulent exchanges (FTX) in 2021.
>
> But Wall Street was never going to buy shitcoins. There was never going to be a "rotation" of smart capital into low IQ alts. Smart money is also (of course) well aware of this pattern of small cap market manipulation and how to exploit it.
>
> How does this play out? BTC pumps, then flattens, alts start to pump from OG coin rotation, then BTC hiccups and nukes every fake alt pump, obliterating shitcoin capital. Then BTC recovers and heads back up. In other words, a long, drawn out cycle with a series of proto-alt-season fake-outs.
>
> This continues until the "0xG" crypto-scammer types are drained of every single bitcoin they didn't deserve in the first place right into the maw of $MSTR and $IBIT.
>
> Sound familiar?
> If not, I have some Zcash to sell you.

- **Quote Author:** Will Clemente III - "Would be pretty wild if CT pivoted out of crypto and whales sold all their coins to bankers, just before the real move in BTC took place with no remaining supply overhang from OGs."
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Bit Paine presents a thesis on the structural difference between smart institutional money and early crypto scammers. Argues that early adopters engaged in pump-and-dump schemes across altcoins, while traditional Wall Street never entered the altcoin market, staying disciplined on Bitcoin only. Describes cycles where retail gets trapped in alt-season fake-outs while institutions accumulate Bitcoin through vehicles like MicroStrategy ($MSTR) and Bitcoin ETFs ($IBIT). The accumulated Bitcoin from undisciplined early crypto actors flows directly to institutional buyers. Characterizes this as an inevitable wealth transfer where Wall Street's patience and capital ultimately drain the Bitcoin holdings of poorly-executed crypto schemes.

- **What:** Analysis of SpaceX's $800B valuation as reflection of U.S. geopolitical dependence on private space infrastructure. Argues SpaceX holds irreplaceable military value through satellite networks, reconnaissance, battlefield communications, GPS redundancy, and missile warning systems—unlike Lockheed, Boeing, or NASA, SpaceX failure would instantly fracture American power projection. Identifies Starlink as first private sovereign infrastructure in history: a parallel communication grid bypassing states, borders, and terrestrial chokepoints, answerable to no nation. Interprets the valuation as market recognition that the federal government has outsourced critical technological capability due to inability to innovate at required velocity. Describes SpaceX as prototype of new geopolitical actor category: hybrid sovereign existing across borders and powering states but not subordinate to them.

Examines how Bitcoin's legitimacy derives from thermodynamics and energy costs ($281,700 per block, $40M to rewrite one day), creating immutability through laws of physics instead of institutional authority. Applies scientific frameworks: Metcalfe's Law (predicts price with 90% accuracy over 15 years), game theory (zero successful attacks in 16 years), and thermodynamic principles for why attack costs exceed defense. Compares Bitcoin to TCP/IP—infrastructure that removes trust requirements always wins, with Bitcoin representing humanity's 16-year validation of physics-based coordination systems.

## @pbeisel - Optimus: AI's Killer App and the Future of Embodied Intelligence

> Tesla's AI team has been grinding for years on one of the hardest technical problems of our time: vehicle autonomy. It's the little team that could— while everyone else chased prestige, giant paychecks, and the chance to bask in the presence of the supposed "AI gods" at the likes of Google and Meta, this group stayed focused and solved autonomy the unglamorous way: pixel by pixel, version by version.
>
> But what they've built isn't just for driving. It's the foundation for Optimus.
>
> Embodied AI is that next interface. It is the interface of AI.
>
> A humanoid robot, Optimus, will be the breakthrough. A natural voice interface, a physical human-like presence, and the ability to manipulate the real world as we do. It's AI you don't just talk to; it's AI that does things.

## @PTrubey - Tesla's Optimus Vision Strategy: Avoiding Lidar Crutches

> Tesla is in another "lidar vs vision" debate, this time with their Optimus bot. Tesla infamously doesn't use lidar for vehicle self driving, something the chattering classes used as a rhetorical weapon against it.
>
> Two bot companies (Figure, Sunday) have palm cameras, but Tesla doesn't and won't.
>
> It's the same philosophy as to why they didn't use lidar. The eventual end goal is low cost, so eliminate anything that isn't ABSOLUTELY necessary. Using a palm camera will speed up training, but it's also a crutch that defers tackling harder problems that you'll eventually want to solve anyway. Finally, humans don't need palm cameras.

## @cybrtrkguy - FSD 14.2 Winter Driving Performance Review

> FSD 14.2 STUNS IN WINTER DRIVING!
>
> Just got done driving ~100 miles on a snowy interstate and a little suburban driving. A few notes:
>
> FSD absolutely, definitively detects snow as a separate substance from rain.
>
> As the snow began to fall, there came a point where FSD first detected the snow and immediately slowed. From then on, it drove in a *completely different profile*.
>
> Generally, V14.2 kept 40-55mph on a 70mph interstate.
>
> When driving in Sloth/Chill and you try to increase the speed profile to Standard/Hurry, the truck displays a red error saying inclement weather is preventing FSD from speeding up. Fantastic!
>
> V14.2 takes corners slow as molasses to keep traction.
>
> It does NOT shoot gaps and pull out in front of other vehicles. V14.2 waits for BIG gaps to make its merge into traffic. It is properly cautious!
>
> One instance of Red Hands occurred when it was merging into a center left turn lane. This center lane was the only lane not plowed, so either 1. it got confused with lane markings or 2. Slid sideways very slightly and got upset.
>
> On straightaways on the interstate in areas with little snow coverage, V14.2 would speed up close to the speed limit. While the roads were wet today from road treatment, I was concerned for slick & frozen areas and manually backed off on the speed. While not technically unsafe, I did this out of an abundance of caution. IMO this is a grey area between "driving safely" and "not driving how I do" lol

## @PhilWhittlesee - Tesla FSD Grok Navigation Route Optimization

> I had a doctor appointment, and was using the navigation and full-self-driving feature to get me there. It is off one of the main streets in the town, but from the direction I'm coming it is impossible to turn into the parking lot due to a concrete median. So, annoyingly, the navigation software always mandates a U-turn.
>
> The most recent update, the 2025 Christmas update, integrated Grok into the navigation system, and you can use Grok voice prompts to adjust your route, add or remove stops, etc. I decided to give that a try.
>
> So I pull up Grok and ask it if can see my destination and route. It confirms that it can, gives me the address, etc. I ask if it can see the U-turn programmed in, and it confirms it with the intersection. I ask it to convert that u-turn to a left-hand-turn instead, and then to proceed about half a block, and then add a new left turn, which will take me into the parking lot via an alternate method.
>
> Easy. Grok does it. Says it has done it. Asks if it looks correct on the screen. The screen zooms in to show the new route in that area. It looks perfect. I say, "Yep, that looks good, execute that." And when we get there, it does!
>
> Coolest damn thing I've seen an AI do. The car drove itself, the AI accessed the data, adjusted the route based on my descriptions and satellite images, and then the car executed it. That is true, agentic AI functioning in my Model Y.

## @BStarr119 - FSD 14.2.1 Cybertruck Advanced Maneuver Execution

> So much to unpack in this one!
>
> FSD just predicted the future and I'm still processing it. Semi in front doing 58, middle lane crawling, overtake lane packed… I'm thinking "welp we're stuck" Mad Max measures closing rates of literally every car around us, sees a pocket forming in the right lane that doesn't even exist yet, dives under the semi (undertake), waits half a beat for the Ram to clear, then slots perfectly into the middle. Zero input from me. It literally calculated relative velocities better than my brain could. 14.2.1 on Cybertruck is straight up psychic now. All-Sight app got the whole magic trick frame-by-frame.

## @karpathy - Agency Over Intelligence: The Underappreciated Competitive Advantage

> *Quoting @garrytan:* Intelligence is on tap now so agency is even more important
>
> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984
- **Quoted:** @garrytan https://x.com/garrytan/status/1894063324582625732
- **Tags:** AI
- **What:** Karpathy argues that agency—the capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and shape one's environment—is more powerful and more valuable than raw intelligence in the AI era. He reflects that he misunderstood this dynamic for decades, influenced by cultural reverence for IQ. With intelligence now commoditized ("on tap"), agency becomes the scarce differentiator. He challenges organizations: Are we hiring for agency? Teaching for agency? This reframes talent and skill development around proactive execution and initiative rather than problem-solving intelligence.

## @karpathy - The Seismic Shift in Programming: Agency and the New Abstraction Layer

> I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521
- **Tags:** AI
- **What:** Andrej Karpathy reflects on feeling profoundly behind in the post-AI era of programming. He describes a fundamental restructuring of the profession where traditional coding contributes increasingly fewer "bits" while a new abstraction layer has emerged involving agents, prompts, MCP, LLMs, and more. The challenge is mastering this new programmable layer while understanding the constraints of stochastic AI systems. He positions this as a skill issue—developers need to mentally model and combine the new AI primitives and tools to unlock 10X productivity gains, but there's no manual for this "alien tool" that's reshaping engineering.

## @srishticodes - Stanford's Free AI/ML Curriculum: Full Degree Content Now Public

> Stanford just made a $200,000 AI degree free.
>
> No application. No tuition. No "elite access".
>
> Stanford released its actual AI/ML curriculum on YouTube. Not a PR-friendly intro. Not "AI for the public".
>
> This is the real thing. The same lectures shaping people working on frontier models.
>
> What just became public:
>
> Deep Learning (CS230), Transformers & LLMs (CME295), Language Models from Scratch (CS336), ML from Human Feedback (CS329H), Computer Vision (CS231N), LLM Evaluation & Scaling

- **What:** Srishti highlights Stanford's decision to release its complete AI/ML curriculum on YouTube—the same courses taught to students working on frontier AI models. This includes rigorous courses on deep learning, transformers, LLMs from scratch, RLHF, and computer vision.

## @theswansjr - Money as Human Consensus vs. Bitcoin's Engineered Nature

> Money does not exist in nature. Bitcoin isn't "real" because it's natural. It's real because we made it that way.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/theswansjr/status/2003458131829932233
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Jeff Swanson explores money as a "shared hallucination" based on human consensus rather than natural law. Traces evolution: seashells → gold → paper → digital. Bitcoin stands apart through deliberate engineering: 21M hard cap, no authority, no counterparty risk, immutable through mathematics rather than politics.

## @shanaka86 - Bitcoin ETF Inflows vs. Gold During Correction

> $IBIT: $25 billion in INFLOWS while BTC down 10%. Opposite of 2013 gold panic. Institutions choosing Bitcoin. 60/40 portfolio becoming 55/35/5/5.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/shanaka86/status/2002163699185037483
- **Quoted:** https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/2002074602739060946
- **Tags:** Bitcoin
- **What:** Institutional behavioral inflection point: during Bitcoin's 10% correction, $IBIT pulled $25B (same amount that caused 2013 gold redemption panic), yet opposite behavior—institutions buying weakness. $IBIT ranked 6th in 2025 ETF flows despite negative returns while gold ran best year since 1979. Predicts 60/40 rebalancing to include Bitcoin allocations, forecasting $150B AUM for $IBIT faster than any fund in history if BTC appreciates 30% in 2026.

## @wintonARK - Mars Development Economics

> on a productivity per mass basis
> we would be ~5x better off building roads with optimi equipped with shovels
> rather than lofting heavy grading equipment to Mars
>
> back on Earth, interesting to think about capital equipment optimizations where the optimization is actually a response to the difficultly/friction of labor mobilization and coordination, rather than an optimization against the raw underlying physics

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/wintonARK/status/1924937480052367626
- **Tags:** Space
- **What:** Brett Winton from Ark Invest discusses Mars colonization economics. Argues that human labor optimized with simple tools (shovels) would be more cost-effective than shipping heavy grading equipment to Mars when measured by productivity per unit mass. Extends analysis to Earth-based capital equipment optimization, noting that many equipment choices are driven by labor coordination challenges rather than raw physics constraints.
