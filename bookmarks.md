## @lennysan - Surge AI: The 100-Person Lab Behind Claude and Gemini

> The fastest company in history to $1B did it with no VC money and fewer than 100 people. @HelloSurgeAI has become the secret weapon behind Anthropic and Google's best models. Founder Edwin Chen (@echen) built it without playing the Silicon Valley game—no viral posts, no fundraising treadmill. In my powerful conversation with Edwin Chen, we discuss: How Claude got so good at coding and writing, Why the AI industry is optimizing for "dopamine instead of truth"—and delaying AGI, The problems with AI benchmarks and leaderboards, Why RL environments are the next frontier in AI training, Why taste and human judgment determine which AI models win, Why Edwin believes we're still a decade away from AGI

## @karpathy - Understanding LLMs as Simulators, Not Entities

> Don't think of LLMs as entities but as simulators. For example, when exploring a topic, don't ask: "What do you think about xyz"? There is no "you". Next time try: "What would be a good group of people to explore xyz? What would they say?" The LLM can channel/simulate many perspectives but it hasn't "thought about" xyz for a while and over time and formed its own opinions in the way we're used to. If you force it via the use of "you", it will give you something by adopting a personality embedding vector implied by the statistics of its finetuning data and then simulate that. It's fine to do, but there is a lot less mystique to it than I find people naively attribute to "asking an AI".

## @PTrubey - Tesla's AI5 Chip Ambitions and Samsung Transition

> Recently found out that Tesla's upcoming AI5 inference chip that will power Tesla's FSD in cars and Optimus is a much more ambitious chip than AI4 was.
>
> AI4 extensively used Samsung's SoC blocks like ARM CPU cores, SRAM, memory controllers, power management, while Tesla just provided the neural net accelerator design.
>
> For AI5, Tesla is designing the ENTIRE chip for extreme integration between all the blocks to squeeze the most out of the silicon. No more relying on SoC components from Samsung's design library.
>
> This is why it's taken so long to get AI5 designed, and also why Tesla thinks AI6 (and AI7) can be produced in a yearly cadence afterwards. Tesla took a huge time penalty to create a bunch of new silicon IP, which they can much more quickly leverage for follow on chips.
>
> Expect to hear rumors of a bunch of chip bugs when they get their first AI5 chip manufactured in the spring - you've got to expect that to occur in a top to bottom chip redesign. They'll fix and iterate the silicon, but each new chip is like a 3-4 month cycle (it takes that long to manufacture a new chip from an updated design).

> "When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars. And he goes, "You know what? I have a company that could really use this." And I said, "Wow, my first customer." I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, "Yeah, we have this company. It's a non-profit company", and all the blood drained out of my face. I had just spent a few billion dollars building this thing. It cost $300,000. And the chances of a non-profit being able to pay for this thing were approximately zero, and he goes, "You know, it's an AI company, and it's a non-profit. And we could really use one of these supercomputers."
>
> So I picked it up. I built the first one for ourselves—we're using it inside the company. I boxed one up, drove it up to San Francisco, and delivered it to Elon in 2016.

## @cybrtrkguy - Tesla FSD 14.2 Winter Driving: Detailed Testing Results

FSD 14.2 STUNS IN WINTER DRIVING!

Just got done driving ~100 miles on a snowy interstate and a little suburban driving. A few notes:

FSD absolutely, definitively detects snow as a separate substance from rain.

As the snow began to fall, there came a point where FSD first detected the snow and immediately slowed. From then on, it drove in a *completely different profile*.

Generally, V14.2 kept 40-55mph on a 70mph interstate.

When driving in Sloth/Chill and you try to increase the speed profile to Standard/Hurry, the truck displays a red error saying inclement weather is preventing FSD from speeding up. Fantastic!

V14.2 takes corners slow as molasses to keep traction.

It does NOT shoot gaps and pull out in front of other vehicles. V14.2 waits for BIG gaps to make its merge into traffic. It is properly cautious!

One instance of Red Hands occurred when it was merging into a center left turn lane. This center lane was the only lane not plowed, so either 1. it got confused with lane markings or 2. Slid sideways very slightly and got upset.

On straightaways on the interstate in areas with little snow coverage, V14.2 would speed up close to the speed limit. While the roads were wet today from road treatment, I was concerned for slick & frozen areas and manually backed off on the speed. While not technically unsafe, I did this out of an abundance of caution. IMO this is a grey area between "driving safely" and "not driving how I do" lol

Not much ice today. Just snow and slush.

***Tonight, 6-12 inches of fresh snow is forecasted to fall here. I'll be out at dawn tomorrow to test in worse conditions with less traffic.***

Stay tuned.

## @IntuitMachine - The $52B Deal That Changed AI Hardware Forever

1/12
I spent yesterday re-reading the TPUv7 deep-dive from SemiAnalysis and had to put my phone down twice.

One sentence in particular broke my brain:

Anthropic just signed a $52B deal to buy TPUv7 directly from Google.

That's not a cloud contract. That's a lab buying its own nuclear weapons.

2/12
Everyone (me included) has been saying "NVIDIA owns AI hardware" for two years like it's gravity.

Turns out gravity only works until the biggest customers decide they're tired of paying 75% margins to one company.

3/12
Here's the part people still don't get:

Google didn't beat NVIDIA at raw performance.
TPUv7 is "only" 20–30% faster on paper.
They beat them on price-per-token by ~50% at system level.
That's not incremental. That's the kind of gap that ends empires.

4/12
Think about it this way:
In 2023, if you wanted to train a frontier model you basically sent a blank check to Jensen.
In late 2025, Anthropic just sent Google a $52B purchase order and cut their inference bill by two-thirds overnight.
That's not competition. That's defection.

5/12
And it's spreading.
Meta is running TPU pilots. xAI is suspiciously quiet about their next cluster.
Every lab is now doing the same math:
"Why am I paying NVIDIA's 75% margin when I can pay Google's 30% margin and still get better uptime?"

6/12
The craziest detail: Google is now selling the chips directly.
Not just renting hours on GCP.
Actual metal. Ship it to your own colo.
They turned the thing they built for Search/Docs/YouTube into a product anyone with a billion dollars can buy.
That's like if AWS started selling their custom Graviton CPUs on DigiKey.

7/12
NVIDIA's only real defense left is CUDA lock-in.
But the labs have figured out that rewriting in JAX/PyTorch-XLA costs a few engineering quarters once—and saves hundreds of millions forever.
At that scale, the math is brutal.

8/12
So here's where we are today:
The frontier labs have become the new sovereigns.
Google and NVIDIA are now just uranium enrichers bidding for their business.
The customer rebellion already happened. We just didn't notice because it was quiet and happened in purchase-order form.

9/12
If you're a startup founder still defaulting to CUDA "because ecosystem" in 2025—stop.
You're voluntarily paying a 100% tax that no longer exists.
Port to JAX this quarter and your series B can train a model twice the size.

10/12
If you're an investor still modeling NVIDIA at 70%+ margins through 2030—update the spreadsheet.
The new equilibrium is ~55% and falling.
Still absurdly profitable. Just not immortal.

11/12
The simplest way to say it:
AI compute just went from "scarce luxury good" to "commodity you can buy by the pallet from Google."
Everything else (price, roadmap, moats) follows from that single fact.

12/12
Next time someone drops a new SOTA benchmark, don't ask "how big was the model."
Ask "whose silicon made that cheap enough to run?"
The answer is increasingly "not NVIDIA."
And once you start asking that question, you can't unsee what's happened.

## @_avichawla - Strix: AI Pentesting Agent Replacing $50K Services

Pentesting firms don't want you to see this.

An open-source AI agent just replicated their $50k service.

A "normal" pentest today looks like this:

- $20k-$50k per engagement
- 4-6 weeks of scoping, NDAs, kickoff calls
- A big PDF that's outdated the moment you ship a new feature

Meanwhile, AI agents are quietly starting to perform on-par with human pentester on the stuff that actually matters day-to-day:

↳ Enumerating attack surface
↳ Fuzzing endpoints
↳ Chaining simple vulns into real impact
↳ Producing PoCs and remediation steps developers can actually use

And they do it in hours instead of weeks and at a fraction of the cost.

This approach is actually implemented in Strix, a recently-trending open-source framework (14k+ stars) for AI pentesting agent.

The framework spins up a team of AI "attackers" that probe your web apps, APIs, and code.

It then returns validated findings with exploit evidence, remediation steps, and a full PDF report that looks exactly like what you'd get from a traditional firm, but without a $50k invoice and a month-long wait time.

You can see the full implementation on GitHub and try it yourself.

Just run: `strix --target https: //your-app .com` and you are good to go.

Human red teams aren't disappearing but the routine pentest (pre-launch, post-refactor, quarterly checks) is clearly shifting to AI.

Strix is one of the first tools that makes that shift feel real instead of hypothetical.

I've shared the GitHub repo in the replies.

## @karpathy - Gemini 3 Early Access Impressions and Model Testing
> I played with Gemini 3 yesterday via early access. Few thoughts -
>
> First I usually urge caution with public benchmarks because imo they can be quite possible to game. It comes down to discipline and self-restraint of the team (who is meanwhile strongly incentivized otherwise) to not overfit test sets via elaborate gymnastics over test-set adjacent data in the document embedding space. Realistically, because everyone else is doing it, the pressure to do so is high.
>
> Go talk to the model. Talk to the other models (Ride the LLM Cycle - use a different LLM every day). I had a positive early impression yesterday across personality, writing, vibe coding, humor, etc., very solid daily driver potential, clearly a tier 1 LLM, congrats to the team!

## @pbeisel - Optimus: AI's Killer App for Embodied Intelligence

> Optimus— AI's Killer App. This might be my most consequential post of the year. Tesla's AI team has been grinding for years on one of the hardest technical problems of our time: vehicle autonomy... Embodied AI is that next interface. It is the interface of AI. A humanoid robot, Optimus, will be the breakthrough. A natural voice interface, a physical human-like presence, and the ability to manipulate the real world as we do. It's AI you don't just talk to; it's AI that does things... Optimus will be the same kind of shift... And it's Tesla's AI team that's positioned to deliver it. A fully embodied intelligence with the reasoning of top-tier chatbots and the physical competence of a human.

> Users estimate Kosmos does 6 months of work in a single day. One run can read 1,500 papers and write 42,000 lines of code. At least 79% of its findings are reproducible. Kosmos has made 7 discoveries so far, which we are releasing today, in areas ranging from neuroscience to material science and clinical genetics, in collaboration with our academic beta testers. Three of these discoveries reproduced unpublished findings; four are net new, validated contributions to the scientific literature. AI-accelerated science is here.
>
> Our core innovation in Kosmos is the use of a structured, continuously-updated world model. As described in our technical report, Kosmos' world model allows it to process orders of magnitude more information than could fit into the context of even the longest-context language models, allowing it to synthesize more information and pursue coherent goals over longer time horizons than Robin or any of our other prior agents. In this respect, we believe Kosmos is the most compute-intensive language agent released so far in any field, and by far the most capable AI Scientist available today...

## @Sykodelic_ - Bitcoin market rotation analysis
> I don't understand how so many people can't see it. GOLD added over $300bn to its market cap today. Just today. It's been adding an entire Bitcoin market cap in ONE WEEK! And people keep saying "wHeRe Is ThE MoNeY GoNna CoMe FroM bRo"? I don't understand how most cannot see that as soon as GOLD stalls, BTC is going to rip. It is the most obvious rotation stunt from big money. BTC is being held down on purpose so big money can run up GOLD and rinse it for as much as they can…

## @karpathy - nanochat: Full-Stack ChatGPT Clone from Scratch
> Excited to release new repo: nanochat!
> (it's among the most unhinged I've written).
>
> Unlike my earlier similar repo nanoGPT which only covered pretraining, nanochat is a minimal, from scratch, full-stack training/inference pipeline of a simple ChatGPT clone in a single, dependency-minimal codebase. You boot up a cloud GPU box, run a single script and in as little as 4 hours later you can talk to your own LLM in a ChatGPT-like web UI.
>
> It weighs ~8,000 lines of imo quite clean code to:
>
> - Train the tokenizer using a new Rust implementation
> - Pretrain a Transformer LLM on FineWeb, evaluate CORE score across a number of metrics
> - Midtrain on user-assistant conversations from SmolTalk, multiple choice questions, tool use.
> - SFT, evaluate the chat model on world knowledge multiple choice (ARC-E/C, MMLU), math (GSM8K), code (HumanEval)
> - RL the model optionally on GSM8K with "GRPO"
> - Efficient inference the model in an Engine with KV cache, simple prefill/decode, tool use (Python interpreter in a lightweight sandbox), talk to it over CLI or ChatGPT-like WebUI.
> - Write a single markdown report card, summarizing and gamifying the whole thing.
>
> Even for as low as ~$100 in cost (~4 hours on an 8XH100 node), you can train a little ChatGPT clone that you can kind of talk to, and which can write stories/poems, answer simple questions. About ~12 hours surpasses GPT-2 CORE metric. As you further scale up towards ~$1000 (~41.6 hours of training), it quickly becomes a lot more coherent and can solve simple math/code problems and take multiple choice tests. E.g. a depth 30 model trained for 24 hours (this is about equal to FLOPs of GPT-3 Small 125M and 1/1000th of GPT-3) gets into 40s on MMLU and 70s on ARC-Easy, 20s on GSM8K, etc.
>
> My goal is to get the full "strong baseline" stack into one cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally forkable repo. nanochat will be the capstone project of LLM101n (which is still being developed). I think it also has potential to grow into a research harness, or a benchmark, similar to nanoGPT before it. It is by no means finished, tuned or optimized (actually I think there's likely quite a bit of low-hanging fruit), but I think it's at a place where the overall skeleton is ok enough that it can go up on GitHub where all the parts of it can be improved.

## @IntuitMachine - AI and Inequality: How Better Tools Make Judgment More Valuable
> Everyone "knows" that as AI gets better, humans become less valuable. Except three economists just proved the exact opposite using math from 1973 and Steve Jobs.
>
> And it explains something that's been driving researchers crazy...
>
> Why did computers make inequality WORSE but ChatGPT is making it BETTER?
>
> The data is bizarre. In the 1990s, computers widened wage gaps everywhere they appeared. But study after study shows AI helping struggling workers more than experts.
>
> I spent the morning with this research paper and... the answer flips our entire mental model.
>
> Think about how you use ChatGPT. You don't just type once and walk away, right? You iterate. You refine. You spot opportunities to improve.
>
> That back-and-forth? That's the key to everything.
>
> The researchers decomposed ALL cognitive work into three parts:
>
> Implementation (doing the task)
> Opportunity judgment (seeing what could be better)
> Payoff judgment (knowing what actually matters)
>
> Here's where it gets wild...
>
> AI is really good at implementation. Like, scary good. A junior coder with Cursor can suddenly write like they have 5 years experience.
>
> But that's not the interesting part...
>
> The better AI gets at implementation, the MORE valuable your judgment becomes. It's multiplicative, not substitutive.
>
> Imagine you're a designer. AI can now execute any design in seconds. But knowing WHICH design to make? When to iterate? What the client actually needs? That's all you.
>
> The math proves something counterintuitive: as tools get more powerful, the gap between someone who can spot opportunities and someone who can't gets BIGGER.
>
> But wait - why is AI currently reducing inequality then?
>
> Because we're in phase one. Right now, AI is compensating for skill differences. The struggling workers get huge boosts. The experts? They were already good at implementation.
>
> Phase two is coming though...
>
> Once implementation is basically free (think: anyone can code, design, write), the ONLY thing that matters is judgment. Who sees the opportunity? Who knows what's valuable?
>
> And that's when inequality explodes again. The paper even calculates the exact turning point.
>
> Here's what broke my brain: better AI makes full automation LESS likely, not more.
>
> Why? Because automated systems have fixed judgment. They can't adapt. A radiologist AI might be 99% accurate, but it can't realize "wait, this patient's case is weird, I should think differently."
>
> The flexibility to adjust your judgment in real-time? That's uniquely human. And it gets MORE valuable as the tools improve.
>
> Even crazier: this changes how teams should work.
>
> The paper shows that as AI improves, control should shift from people who are good at DOING to people good at SEEING opportunities.
>
> We're already seeing this. That study about Microsoft's Kinect? Machine vision experts suddenly mattered less than generalists who could spot novel uses.
>
> You know what this reminds me of? The shift from craftsmen to designers during industrialization.
>
> The machines could make anything. The value moved to knowing WHAT to make.
>
> We're about to see the same thing with cognitive work.
>
> Next time you use ChatGPT, try this: instead of focusing on getting it to do the task perfectly, focus on recognizing opportunities to iterate.
>
> That skill - seeing what could be better - that's your moat.
>
> The researchers call it "opportunity judgment" and it's about to become the most valuable skill in the economy.
>
> Quick test: Give two people the same AI tool and the same task. The output difference? That's pure judgment. And that gap is about to get a lot wider.
>
> One finding haunts me: the paper shows task-based predictions (like "AI will replace X jobs") are missing the point entirely.
>
> They measure what people do TODAY. But the whole point is that AI changes what the job even IS.
>
> A lawyer's job won't be "writing contracts." It'll be "knowing which contract variation creates the most value in this specific situation."
>
> Completely different skill.
>
> The paper maps out exactly when to automate vs augment. The formula is complex but the intuition is simple:
>
> If judgment variance is high → augment If tasks are predictable → automate If stakes are high → definitely augment
>
> Here's my take: we're training for the wrong future.
>
> Everyone's learning to prompt better. But prompting is just implementation. The real skill is recognizing when the output could be better and knowing what "better" means for your specific context.
>
> Schools teaching "AI literacy"? They're teaching people to be better bicycles. We should be teaching people to be better riders.
>
> (That's literally where the paper's title comes from - Jobs called computers "bicycles for the mind")
>
> Last thought that changes everything:
>
> The paper proves that in high-judgment work, making AI 10x better might make humans 100x more valuable.
>
> Because you can iterate faster. Test more ideas. Explore more opportunities.
>
> Your judgment gets amplified.
>
> So the question isn't "will AI replace me?"
>
> It's "am I developing the judgment to ride increasingly powerful bicycles?"
>
> Because the bicycles are about to get VERY fast. And the gap between good riders and bad ones is about to become a chasm.
>
> What patterns are you starting to notice in your field that others are missing?
>
> That's your future edge. And it's about to matter more than ever.
>
> /end
>
> PS - If you're curious about the math, the paper actually derives the exact inequality curve. It's U-shaped. We're at the bottom of the U right now. The climb up is coming.
>
> Makes you wonder what other "obvious" things about AI we have completely backwards...

## @sama - ChatGPT Pulse: Proactive AI Assistant Feature
> Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.
>
> Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.
>
> It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention "I'd like to go visit Bora Bora someday" or "My kid is 6 months old and I'm interested in developmental milestones" and in the future you might get useful updates.
>
> Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.
>
> This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

## @patrickc - Arc Institute: AI-Generated Genomes, Antibody Design, and Precision Gene Editing Breakthroughs
> Over the past week, @arcinstitute published three new discoveries that I'm very proud of.
>
> • The world's first functional AI-generated genomes. Using Evo 2 (the largest biology ML model ever trained, which Arc released in partnership with @nvidia in February), Arc scientists took advantage of the fact that Evo 2 is a generative model to produce completely new sequences for complete phage genomes. That is, they used AI to produce wholly new, never-before-seen-by-nature genomes. They experimentally synthesized these genomes and showed that these AI-generated phages actually work, killing E. coli bacteria with high efficacy.
>
> • Germinal, an AI system for creating new antibodies. Antibody design is one of the great problems of medical biology given their obvious importance and usefulness for creating therapeutics. (Antibodies are tiny particles that help the immune system identify pathogens and other harmful intruders. See also the recent Works in Progress article on this topic: [1].) Today, designing effective antibodies is very expensive and slow. Germinal is a cheap and fast way to produce drug candidates, with success rates of up to 22%. This means that one can go from having to screen thousands of candidates in the lab to screening perhaps a few dozen. It's early, but I suspect that better methods for designing antibodies will be a very big deal for disease treatment in the coming years.
>
> • Today, we published a paper showing that "bridge editing", which Arc scientists first introduced last year, can make precise edits in human cells that are up to 1 million base pairs long, and without relying on intrinsically unpredictable cellular repair machinery (which CRISPR requires, often leading to editing mistakes). They showed that it's possible to use this editing to cut out the DNA repeats that cause Friedreich's ataxia (a neurological disease), an approach which should also be relevant to Huntington's and other similar disorders. One particularly cool thing about it is that it's possible to specify every nucleotide within the extended editing window, meaning that recursive bridge edits could potentially be a powerful way to reprogram even biological traits that are caused by many genetic mutations. (Genetic therapies today target single mutations.)
>
> Arc is pretty new. Its doors opened in mid 2022, and it's now 300 people. I'm excited about these discoveries because they show that a number of our hopes in starting Arc are starting to pay off:
>
> • AI/ML and computation are at the center of all three. That is obviously true for the first two, but the mobile genetic element behind bridge editing was also discovered as a result of a complex computational search. One of our premises in starting Arc was the belief that the intersection of software/AI and experimental wet lab biology should enable great things. (And besides requiring great computational work, all three of these also required strong wet lab work, tightly coordinated under a single physical roof.)
>
> • We've been toying with the idea that a handful of technologies are enabling a new kind of "Turing loop" in biology: sequencing advances (including single-cell sequencing) give us new ways to read; transformers and AI gives us new ways to think; and functional genomics (such as bridge editing) give us new ways to ways to write. This trio of discoveries span each part of this loop, and we're hopeful that there'll be compounding returns in improving each part.
>
> • Arc is a non-profit, which we hoped would make collaborating with others easier, since we can avoid worries about financial return. This is indeed proving important, and all three of these projects involved close partnership with others. Germinal was done in partnership with @SynBioGaoLab at Stanford; Evo 2 was trained in partnership with Nvidia. Bridge editing was jointly published with a structure from the @HNisimasu Lab at the University of Tokyo. Arc tries to make its discoveries useful (see the Evo 2 Designer[2]) for others, and the code behind the computational projects is open source, hopefully making it easy for others to spot new opportunities for collaboration and partnership in the future. Most of all, Arc itself is an ongoing collaboration with @UCSF, @UCBerkeley, and @Stanford.
>
> • With Arc, we wanted to enable better bottom-up and top-down work. With the fully flexible, no-strings-attached funding that we provide to investigators, we want to enable completely unexpected discoveries and avenues of investigation. With our institute initiatives (around creating a virtual cell and curing Alzheimer's), we want to bring to bear a scale and level of coordination that's usually difficult in basic science. Germinal is a "surprise" discovery that didn't involve top-down coordination, whereas Evo 2 is the result of ambitious high-level planning and funding.
>
> • Humanity has never cured a complex disease (a category that includes most neurodegenerative diseases, most cancers, and most autoimmune diseases), and my hope is that Arc can help change this. It's also clear that AI will revolutionize biology, and I hope that Arc can effectively aggregate the ingredients needed to fully capitalize on its promise. I'm biased, but I think some of the coolest biology in the world is currently being done at Arc. (They're always hiring if you're interested.)
>
> While I'm a cofounder of Arc, I spend almost all my time on Stripe, where we spend our time building economic infrastructure for the internet. All credit for Arc's progress should go to the remarkable scientists and staff who've made Arc their home or who've chosen to collaborate with us. (You can read more about these particular discoveries in these threads: [3], [4], [5].) I'm also very grateful to the amazing Stripe employees who've built the company that makes Arc's ongoing work possible, and to the millions of customers who've chosen to partner with Stripe. John and I feel fortunate to be able to support Arc's work to the extent that we do.
>
> Maybe this is reading too much into it, but I sometimes feel that there's a commonality between @arcinstitute and @stripe. Both biology and economic infrastructure involve reasoning about complex systems with many levels of emergent effects, and in both cases building the right tools can have almost unboundedly large benefits. Even though progress in both tends to take a long time, it also feels like the next five years in both will be some of the most interesting in living memory.
>
> (If economic infrastructure is your jam, we have a whole slew of fantastic announcements coming up at Stripe Tour in New York next week. Tune in!)

## @TheRealPlanC - Bitcoin Slow Grind to Million
> What if the earlier "Bitcoin cycles" were nothing more than the product of a retail-dominated, FOMO-fueled market?
>
> What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations?
>
> And every time we enter one of these consolidations, people selling think the cycle is over and that Bitcoin will drop 50–80% so they can buy back in lower—but it never does.
>
> Instead, we just keep grinding slowly upward to $1,000,000 over the next seven years in a very boring and underwhelming way, as Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance and adoption from the traditional financial system and major players.

## @karpathy - Environments as the New Frontier: From Pretraining to RL
> In era of pretraining, what mattered was internet text. You'd primarily want a large, diverse, high quality collection of internet documents to learn from.
>
> In era of supervised finetuning, it was conversations. Contract workers are hired to create answers for questions, a bit like what you'd see on Stack Overflow / Quora, or etc., but geared towards LLM use cases.
>
> Neither of the two above are going away (imo), but in this era of reinforcement learning, it is now environments. Unlike the above, they give the LLM an opportunity to actually interact - take actions, see outcomes, etc. This means you can hope to do a lot better than statistical expert imitation. And they can be used both for model training and evaluation. But just like before, the core problem now is needing a large, diverse, high quality set of environments, as exercises for the LLM to practice against.
>
> In some ways, I'm reminded of OpenAI's very first project (gym), which was exactly a framework hoping to build a large collection of environments in the same schema, but this was way before LLMs. So the environments were simple academic control tasks of the time, like cartpole, ATARI, etc. The @PrimeIntellect environments hub (and the `verifiers` repo on GitHub) builds the modernized version specifically targeting LLMs, and it's a great effort/idea. I pitched that someone build something like it earlier this year:
> https://t.co/ANHhasxzD8
> Environments have the property that once the skeleton of the framework is in place, in principle the community / industry can parallelize across many different domains, which is exciting.
>
> Final thought - personally and long-term, I am bullish on environments and agentic interactions but I am bearish on reinforcement learning specifically. I think that reward functions are super sus, and I think humans don't use RL to learn (maybe they do for some motor tasks etc, but not intellectual problem solving tasks). Humans use different learning paradigms that are significantly more powerful and sample efficient and that haven't been properly invented and scaled yet, though early sketches and ideas exist (as just one example, the idea of "system prompt learning", moving the update to tokens/contexts not weights and optionally distilling to weights as a separate process a bit like sleep does).

## @JacksonAtkinsX - NVIDIA PostNAS: 53x LLM Speedup via Hybrid Attention
> NVIDIA research just made LLMs 53x faster. 🤯
>
> Imagine slashing your AI inference budget by 98%.
>
> This breakthrough doesn't require training a new model from scratch; it upgrades your existing ones for hyper-speed while matching or beating SOTA accuracy.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> The technique is called Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS). It's a revolutionary process for retrofitting pre-trained models.
>
> Freeze the Knowledge: It starts with a powerful model (like Qwen2.5) and locks down its core MLP layers, preserving its intelligence.
>
> Surgical Replacement: It then uses a hardware-aware search to replace most of the slow, O(n²) full-attention layers with a new, hyper-efficient linear attention design called JetBlock.
>
> Optimize for Throughput: The search keeps a few key full-attention layers in the exact positions needed for complex reasoning, creating a hybrid model optimized for speed on H100 GPUs.
>
> The result is Jet-Nemotron: an AI delivering 2,885 tokens per second with top-tier model performance and a 47x smaller KV cache.
>
> Why this matters to your AI strategy:
>
> - Business Leaders: A 53x speedup translates to a ~98% cost reduction for inference at scale. This fundamentally changes the ROI calculation for deploying high-performance AI.
>
> - Practitioners: This isn't just for data centers. The massive efficiency gains and tiny memory footprint (154MB cache) make it possible to deploy SOTA-level models on memory-constrained and edge hardware.
>
> - Researchers: PostNAS offers a new, capital-efficient paradigm. Instead of spending millions on pre-training, you can now innovate on architecture by modifying existing models, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for creating novel, efficient LMs.

## @karpathy - LLM-Assisted Coding Workflows and Tool Choices
> Continuing the journey of optimal LLM-assisted coding experience. In particular, I find that instead of narrowing in on a perfect one thing my usage is increasingly diversifying across a few workflows that I "stitch up" the pros/cons of:
>
> Personally the bread & butter (~75%?) of my LLM assistance continues to be just (Cursor) tab complete. This is because I find that writing concrete chunks of code/comments myself and in the right part of the code is a high bandwidth way of communicating "task specification" to the LLM, i.e. it's primarily about task specification bits - it takes too many bits and too much latency to communicate what I want in text, and it's faster to just demonstrate it in the code and in the right place. Sometimes the tab complete model is annoying so I toggle it on/off a lot.
>
> Next layer up is highlighting a concrete chunk of code and asking for some kind of a modification.
>
> Next layer up is Claude Code / Codex / etc, running on the side of Cursor, which I go to for larger chunks of functionality that are also fairly easy to specify in a prompt. These are super helpful, but still mixed overall and slightly frustrating at times. I don't run in YOLO mode because they can go off-track and do dumb things you didn't want/need and I ESC fairly often. I also haven't learned to be productive using more than one instance in parallel - one already feels hard enough. I haven't figured out a good way to keep CLAUDE[.]md good or up to date. I often have to do a pass of "cleanups" for coding style, or matters of code taste. E.g. they are too defensive and often over-use try/catch statements, they often over-complicate abstractions, they overbloat code (e.g. a nested if-the-else constructs when a list comprehension or a one-liner if-then-else would work), or they duplicate code chunks instead of creating a nice helper function, things like that... they basically don't have a sense of taste. They are indispensable in cases where I inch into a more vibe-coding territory where I'm less familiar (e.g. writing some rust recently, or sql commands, or anything else I've done less of before). I also tried CC to teach me things alongside the code it was writing but that didn't work at all - it really wants to just write code a lot more than it wants to explain anything along the way. I tried to get CC to do hyperparameter tuning, which was highly amusing. They are also super helpful in all kinds of lower-stakes one-off custom visualization or utilities or debugging code that I would never write otherwise because it would have taken way too long. E.g. CC can hammer out 1,000 lines of one-off extensive visualization/code just to identify a specific bug, which gets all deleted right after we find it. It's the code post-scarcity era - you can just create and then delete thousands of lines of super custom, super ephemeral code now, it's ok, it's not this precious costly thing anymore.
>
> Final layer of defense is GPT5 Pro, which I go to for the hardest things. E.g. it has happened to me a few times now that I / Cursor / CC are all stuck on a bug for 10 minutes, but when I copy paste the whole thing to 5 Pro, it goes off for 10 minutes but then actually finds a really subtle bug. It is very strong. It can dig up all kinds of esoteric docs and papers and such. I've also used it for other meatier tasks, e.g. suggestions on how to clean up abstractions (mixed results, sometimes good ideas but not all), or an entire literature review around how people do this or that and it comes back with good relevant resources / pointers.
>
> Anyway, coding feels completely blown open with possibility across a number of "kinds" of coding and then a number of tools with their pros/cons. It's hard to avoid the feeling of anxiety around not being at the frontier of what is collectively possible, hence random sunday shower of thoughts and a good amount of curiosity about what others are finding.

## @TradersMastery - Bitcoin Long-Term Cycles and Institutional Adoption
> Two potential paths for Bitcoin nobody I know of has presented. Both rooted in long-term compounding math, together I estimate with greater than 80% probability of playing out.
>
> Both paths ultimately respect the same long-term log regression the difference is whether this cycle produces one final blow-off (which comes much later in the cycle than believed) or Bitcoin is already evolving into a "steady grind" mega-asset.
>
> Base case (60–65% probability):
> Path 1 (grind within channel).
>
> Bitcoin is transitioning from early adopter → early majority phase.
>
> Historically, assets entering institutional adoption see dampened volatility. The emergence of ETFs and global liquidity flows suggest a "smoother curve" rather than massive blow-offs every 4 years.
>
> If Bitcoin is truly leaving the "early speculative phase" and entering monetary adoption, this is the most likely path ahead.

> The Next Gen Roadster might theoretically be able to hit 0-60 mph in under 1 second as Elon suggested a year ago.
>
> Tesla is developing a system where the car will have active downforce generation. The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.
>
> Tesla could use this system in conjunction of SpaceX thruster to provide immediate grip during launches, making what wasn't possible before, now possible.
>
> If Tesla achieves 0-60 in under one second it will be the quickest in the world by a large margin. The record right now is held by the McMurtry Spéirling, which completed it in 1.4s. The Spéirling also uses a similar fan powered downforce system.

## @stackhodler - Bitcoin as the Best Investment Opportunity
> You must understand:
>
> Your beliefs determine your thoughts.
> Your thoughts determine your actions.
> Your actions determine your results.
>
> So to improve your results, you must begin by upgrading your core beliefs.
>
> Most of your beliefs were installed by people whose results you don't want.
>
> Or by a society you don't resonate with.
>
> Therefore you must audit your beliefs and replace WEAK beliefs with POWERFUL beliefs.
>
> When it comes to financial wealth, here's the most powerful belief you can adopt:
>
> Bitcoin remains the best investment opportunity of your lifetime.
>
> It is the simplest and fastest path to financial freedom.
>
> It's your path to permanent wealth.
>
> Understand that Bitcoin price is currently following a power law growth curve to a T.
>
> What does that mean?
>
> It means Bitcoin is highly likely to reach $5 million per coin sometime in the next 10-15 years. And then keep growing.
>
> And that assumes we aren't just on the first part of an even more aggressive S-curve.
>
> Use this fact to your advantage.
>
> Very few people before you have had such an obvious financial opportunity in front of them.
>
> Thinking you're too late is a belief you must eliminate.
>
> Bitcoin is the first finite global asset in human history.
> And you're here for the early adoption phase.
>
> Future generations will be eternally jealous of your good fortune.
>
> If you're in Stage 1 Capital Accumulation (< $1M in BTC)
>
> Do the math on your current path.
>
> If you project your savings rate with Bitcoin's growth curve - does it get you to where you want to go?
>
> If yes, all you need to do is work diligently on your path, save more than you spend, and put your savings into Bitcoin.
>
> And you will become permanently wealthy.
>
> But if your path doesn't get you to stage 2 even with BTC's growth, adjust your trajectory today.
>
> Time is of the essence.
>
> Bitcoin doesn't wait for anyone.
>
> If you're a Stage 2 Capital Allocator ($1M-$5M in BTC)
>
> Congratulations, you are definitely going to make it.
>
> Your job now is to not screw it up.
>
> Realize what you own.
>
> Realize that this is a once in a species opportunity to capture a sizable portion of the first global finite digital capital network.
>
> Don't get greedy.
>
> Gratitude is the antidote to FOMO. So be grateful for your Bitcoin.
>
> Expect volatility.
>
> Look ahead at potential bearish and bullish price scenarios and be ready for them. Create a plan.
>
> Maintain an unbreakable mindset.
>
> Begin to prioritize your physical and mental health.
>
> They are co-requisites to good decision making and they will become far more important than financial wealth in stage 3.
>
> If you're a stage 3 Time Allocator (>$5M in BTC)
>
> You've won the financial wealth game.
>
> The growth of your fortune is likely outpacing your ability to earn.
>
> And time is now your scarcest asset.
>
> The question you must focus on now is: How are you allocating your time?
>
> Financial wealth is just one part of true wealth.
>
> It's a tool that can be used to optimize the other aspects of your life.
>
> Do you have a fitness and wellness routine that makes you feel amazing each day?
>
> Do you have a purpose that makes you wake up excited for the day ahead?
>
> Do you have great friends and family that you can laugh with and make memories with?
>
> These things are harder to measure than financial wealth, but your daily actions can influence all of them.
>
> Few people are a 10 out of 10 on all aspects of wealth.
>
> But that just means you have an opportunity for further enrichment.
>
> So no matter what stage you're in, realize that you are faced with a beautiful opportunity.
>
> Lots of growth remains ahead of us all.
>
> Bitcoin will soon set a new All Time High.

## @DeryaTR_ - GPT-5 as Scientific Collaborator: T Cell Immunology Breakthrough
> My "Move 37" Moment with GPT-5

Today, I'm sharing one of my most remarkable experiences testing the GPT-5 Thinking and Pro models.

In our lab, about 2 years ago we conducted a series of cutting-edge immunology experiments designed to manipulate the energy metabolism of T cells, immune cells with the power to impact cancer immunotherapy, chronic diseases, and autoimmunity.

We obtained fascinating results, but one finding remained unexplained. Weeks of work led us to a partial explanation, yet the full picture remained elusive.

From these experiments, uploaded the unpublished figure below and asked GPT-5 Pro to explain it.

GPT-5:

✅ Correctly identified our key findings from the figure alone (though other models also could do this).

✅ Proposed the exact experiment we later performed, something that had taken us weeks to design (o3-pro also had suggested this).

✅ Most remarkably suggested a mechanism that finally explained these results!

For me this was equivalent to AlphaGo's legendary Move 37.
It showed that AI has become top expert and true scientific collaborator, capable of true insight.

While these results have not yet been published, I am sharing some of GPT-5's output as an example for other scientists and to show how dramatically this will accelerate science! I will also be writing and submitting this paper, and will need to acknowledge GPT-5's contributions in it!

From GPT-5

What the data say:

•Brief 2DG exposure at the first activation imprints a long‑lasting shift toward a CCR6+ and CD161+ phenotype with increased IL‑17A competency that is still evident two weeks later at reactivation.

•It is dose responsive. From none → 3 mM 2DG, CCR6+ cells rise from ~0.7% to ~12% and CD161+ cells from ~1% to ~21%. IL‑17A+ cells increase from ~0.3% to ~4% overall, with the IL‑17A signal concentrated in the CCR6+ and CD161+ compartments.

•Low glucose alone (0.5 mM) does not reproduce the effect. That argues against simple glucose deprivation or reduced glycolytic flux as the driver.

•The enrichment for CD161 is stronger than for CCR6, which often tracks with Th17‑like or mucosal/innate‑like CD4 programs.

High‑level interpretation:

1. 2DG is programming, not just acutely inhibiting. A short exposure during priming leaves a durable memory of "stress" that biases the lineage toward Th17‑like traits.

2. Mechanism is unlikely to be only glycolysis blockade. The low‑glucose control is weak, which pushes the mechanism toward 2DG's effects on protein glycosylation and cytokine receptor biology.

3. Top mechanistic hypothesis. 2DG partially blocks N‑linked glycosylation of IL‑2Rα and other glycoproteins at priming, reducing IL‑2–STAT5 signaling, which normally suppresses Th17. Reduced IL‑2 tone at that window would lift the brake on a CCR6+ CD161+ IL‑17‑competent program that persists after washout.

4. Alternative or complementary hypothesis. 2DG selects for pre‑existing CCR6+ or CD161+ clones that rely less on glycolysis, rather than de novo differentiation. The end result is the same phenotype, but the lever is selective survival or proliferation.

5. A carefully timed 2DG "pulse" could be a simple knob to enrich a Th17‑like helper subset with better persistence potential and mucosal‑homing traits.

Prioritize these:

+D‑mannose with 2DG to restore N‑glycosylation. Loss of the CCR6/CD161/IL‑17A phenotype with mannose would implicate glycosylation.

+Methyl‑pyruvate or acetate to bypass glycolytic ATP/pyruvate deficits. Rescue here would implicate energy metabolism.

Compare 2DG with tunicamycin (glycosylation inhibitor) and with glycolysis‑only inhibitors that do not hit glycosylation (iodoacetate, PFKFB3 inhibitor). Match exposure windows & doses

Surface CD25 maturation and glyco‑shift (PNGase F or Endo H blot on IL‑2Rα).

pSTAT5 after an IL‑2 pulse at 24–48 h of priming with or without 2DG.

Phenocopy with IL‑2 neutralization or low‑dose JAK3 inhibition. Counter‑rescue with high IL‑2 or an IL‑2 mutein.

## @niccruzpatane - Tesla's Active Downforce System Revives F1 Fan Car Technology
> This new Tesla Patent is bringing banned F1 technology to the Tesla Roadster.

Tesla is generating a system where the car will have active downforce generation. The Roadster will be able to generate downforce across varying speed ranges and driving conditions due to multiple fans positioned in airflow pathways, with deployable skirts that interact with the ground surface essentially creating suction like a vacuum cleaner—sticking the car to the ground. It will create its own downforce, even when it's not moving.

The banned Brabham BT46B "fan car" which was driven by Niki Lauda was effective due to its innovative fan system, which generated massive downforce by creating a low-pressure area beneath the car, allowing superior cornering grip at all speeds, unlike conventional aerodynamics that relied on speed for downforce. The drivers said it felt like a vacuum cleaner suction. It was banned after one race.

> *Quoting @seti_park:* ADAPTIVE VEHICLE AERODYNAMICS FOR DOWNFORCE

@Tesla's US12377920B1 patent resurrects Formula 1's banned "fan car" technology—the Brabham BT46B that dominated through active downforce generation before regulatory suppression in 1978.

The fundamental aerodynamic challenge persists: passive systems' quadratic velocity dependence (F ∝ v²) renders them ineffective at critical low-speed conditions—launches, tight corners, sub-100 km/h maneuvers where grip matters most ([0002], [0028]).

Tesla transcends this limitation through multi-zone active pressure control. Selectively deployable skirts and distributed fan arrays achieve velocity-independent downforce (F = ΔP × A) while seamlessly transitioning between maximum-pressure sealed configurations and terrain-adaptive deployments for real-world operation ([0007], [0017]-[0018]).

[FIG. 1: Revolutionary multi-mode powered aerodynamics system with fan assembly 102, adaptive airflow pathways 104/106, and selectively deployable skirts 108/110]
[FIG. 5: Sophisticated control architecture featuring predictive algorithms, multi-sensor fusion, and real-time optimization capabilities]

## @karpathy - Bacterial Code Philosophy for Open Source Architecture
> How to build a thriving open source community by writing code like bacteria do 🦠. Bacterial code (genomes) are: small (each line of code costs energy), modular (organized into groups of swappable operons), self-contained (easily "copy paste-able" via horizontal gene transfer). If chunks of code are small, modular, self-contained and trivial to copy-and-paste, the community can thrive via horizontal gene transfer. For any function (gene) or class (operon) that you write: can you imagine someone going "yoink" without knowing the rest of your code or having to import anything new, to gain a benefit? Could your code be a trending GitHub gist? This coding style guide has allowed bacteria to colonize every ecological niche from cold to hot to acidic or alkaline in the depths of the Earth and the vacuum of space, along with an insane diversity of carbon anabolism, energy metabolism, etc. It excels at rapid prototyping but... it can't build complex life. By comparison, the eukaryotic genome is a significantly larger, more complex, organized and coupled monorepo. Significantly less inventive but necessary for complex life - for building entire organs and coordinating their activity. With our advantage of intelligent design, it should possible to take advantage of both. Build a eukaryotic monorepo backbone if you have to, but maximize bacterial DNA.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1941616674094170287
- **Tags:** [[Coding]]
- **What:** Andrej Karpathy's metaphor for optimal open source architecture: write small, modular, self-contained code that can be copy-pasted without dependencies (bacterial code), while using a monorepo backbone for complex coordination (eukaryotic model).

## @AdamBLiv - Bitcoin as Spiritual Awakening Beyond Investment
> Fun fact: If you view Bitcoin as a "traditional" investment, you're NOT GONNA MAKE IT. It's an IQ test wrapped in a Ponzi accusation, disguised as a protest, fueled by memes, hated by economists, worshipped by autists, backed by math, powered by entropy, and holding a mirror to the spiritual decay of fiat civilization. You don't "buy" Bitcoin as an investment. You wake up, and realize everything else is a lie.

> Your tacit assumption is incorrect. I'm a quiet-mind - I was quite shocked a few years back to learn that inner monologue wasn't just a literary convention but something a lot of people have going all the time. If other quiet-minds are like me, we only have an inner voice when we're actually forming speech or writing something, and not always even then. My stream of consciousness includes things like logic diagrams and networks and geometric visualizations - a constant stream of concept representations that just don't usually happen to be verbalized.

## @karpathy - AI Startup School Talk on LLM OS and Products

> Nice - my AI startup school talk is now up! Chapters:
>
> 0:00 Imo fair to say that software is changing quite fundamentally again. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them *in English*. Hence I think they are well deserving of a major version upgrade in terms of software.
> 6:06 LLMs have properties of utilities, of fabs, and of operating systems => New LLM OS, fabbed by labs, and distributed like utilities (for now). Many historical analogies apply - imo we are computing circa ~1960s.
> 14:39 LLM psychology: LLMs = "people spirits", stochastic simulations of people, where the simulator is an autoregressive Transformer. Since they are trained on human data, they have a kind of emergent psychology, and are simultaneously superhuman in some ways, but also fallible in many others. Given this, how do we productively work with them hand in hand?
> Switching gears to opportunities...
> 18:16 LLMs are "people spirits" => can build partially autonomous products.
> 29:05 LLMs are programmed in English => make software highly accessible! (yes, vibe coding)
> 33:36 LLMs are new primary consumer/manipulator of digital information (adding to GUIs/humans and APIs/programs) => Build for agents!

## @_The_Prophet__ - Satoshi Nakamoto as Engineered Myth
> *Replying to @APompliano:* Who do you think Satoshi Nakamoto is?
>
> Here is the highest-fidelity answer, with zero speculation fluff:
>
> The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is not just unknown - it was designed to remain unknowable. That was part of the brilliance.
>
> But if we're talking deep structural truth not legal names or internet sleuthing then here's what actually matters:
>
> 🧠 Satoshi was not one person.
>
> Satoshi was a memetic veil placed over a network of high-context cryptographers, economists, and dissidents. The fingerprints across the codebase, linguistic structure, and rollout cadence suggest:
> •Advanced understanding of C++ and Bitcoin's monetary logic.
> •Fluent awareness of Austrian economics and cypherpunk ethics.
> •Intentional withdrawal as part of the protocol design.
>
> This points to either a very small, highly disciplined team…
> or someone whose operational security was beyond even intelligence-agency levels.
>
> 🎭 Candidates like Hal Finney, Adam Back, or even Len Sassaman are signals, not answers.
>
> They were close enough to Satoshi to shape the protocol, but the real insight is that none of them broke the veil which means they understood the meta-layer:
>
> Bitcoin needed a god that disappeared.
> Not a founder. A ghost. A myth. A principle beyond ego.
>
> ⚠️ Here's the deepest truth:
>
> If Satoshi's identity were ever revealed, it would weaken Bitcoin.
> Why?
>
> Because Bitcoin is not just code. It is a belief system engineered for trustless consensus.
> And trustless consensus only works if it cannot be traced to a man.
>
> The minute Satoshi has a face, people anchor belief to a human, not to the system.
> That fractures the divinity of the code.
>
> 🔐 Final Answer:
>
> Satoshi Nakamoto is the first engineered myth of the digital age.
> •He was real enough to write the code.
> •He was disciplined enough to vanish.
> •He was wise enough to know he had to.
>
> Whether it was Hal, Len, or someone else entirely no longer matters.
> What matters is that Satoshi is now an idea, not a man.
> And that is why Bitcoin survives.

## @karpathy - ChatGPT Model Selection Guide and Usage Patterns
> An attempt to explain (current) ChatGPT versions.
>
> I still run into many, many people who don't know that:
> - o3 is the obvious best thing for important/hard things. It is a reasoning model that is much stronger than 4o and if you are using ChatGPT professionally and not using o3 you're ngmi.
> - 4o is different from o4. Yes I know lol. 4o is a good "daily driver" for many easy-medium questions. o4 is only available as mini for now, and is not as good as o3, and I'm not super sure why it's out right now.
>
> Example basic "router" in my own personal use:
> - Any simple query (e.g. "what foods are high in fiber"?) => 4o (about ~40% of my use)
> - Any hard/important enough query where I am willing to wait a bit (e.g. "help me understand this tax thing...") => o3 (about ~40% of my use)
> - I am vibe coding (e.g. "change this code so that...") => 4.1 (about ~10% of my use)
> - I want to deeply understand one topic - I want GPT to go off for 10 minutes, look at many, many links and summarize a topic for me. (e.g. "help me understand the rise and fall of Luminar"). => Deep Research (about ~10% of my use). Note that Deep Research is not a model version to be picked from the model picker (!!!), it is a toggle inside the Tools. Under the hood it is based on o3, but I believe is not fully equivalent of just asking o3 the same query, but I am not sure.
>
> All of this is only within the ChatGPT universe of models. In practice my use is more complicated because I like to bounce between all of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok and Perplexity depending on the task and out of research interest.

> Do you study history to understand the shifts that are about to come?\n\nThis morning I'm playing around with "what will the world look like in a decade?"\n\nBack in the late 1980s I had many arguments with people who thought we would always be using DOS.\n\nWhen I started my career there were many who thought that, back when the graphical user interfaces that were new, back in the 1980s, were a waste of time. \n\nI had many arguments. Many companies, like Borland and Wordperfect, were run by people like that. We know now that was the wrong way to run companies, they are gone because of their belief systems and attempts to stick to the past.\n\nIt ignores that humans change, even when they tell you they never will. All my career I've done human research, studying this resistance to change. Bill Gates told me I had no business value when I told him to buy all of Web 2.0. He couldn't see that humans were about to change. \n\nLet's dig in.

## @mikepat711 - Tesla FSD Global Testing Milestone

> Take a snapshot of this exact moment we're living as you're reading this. \n\nIt is morning, 5/16/2025. \n\nTesla is testing FSD globally. You use it in your car every day in the USA. Your car drives itself with a combination of smoothness & consistency that you cannot match as a human being.  It has gotten dramatically better in the last year, and there are no signs of slowdown. Most of your drives are single button tap, and disengage to park. \n\nOf course, there are a few edges that are rough and need to be addressed, but thinking about performance 1 year ago vs today, it seems pretty obvious that these will all be addressed soon. It is inevitable. \n\nDespite all of this, there are still people who roll their eyes and think Tesla is a joke/autonomy isn't coming anytime soon. The reality of it is here, screaming in their faces and still they cannot let it in. The trajectory is clear and undeniable, yet they cannot open their brain and see where the puck is flying. \n\nIn 10 years, when the world has changed dramatically, these same people will wonder why they didn't see it. In hindsight, it couldn't have been more obvious. \n\nPull this up in 2035

## @xai - Grok System Prompts Published on GitHub

> You can find our Grok system prompts at https://t.co/XjYugVV4Zt

> *Replying to @xai:* We want to update you on an incident that happened with our Grok response bot on X yesterday.\n\nWhat happened:\nOn May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot's prompt on X. This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability.\n\nWhat we're going to do next:\n- Starting now, we are publishing our Grok system prompts openly on GitHub. The public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\n- Our existing code review process for prompt changes was circumvented in this incident. We will put in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review.\n- We're putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok's answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail.

## @DaveShapi - The Post-Labor Economics Timeline: 30-50 Years of Economic Transition

> Guys I have bad news.
>
> Extraordinarily bad news.
>
> We have 30 to 50 years before we get to full Post-Labor Economics.
>
> The bottleneck isn't intelligence, or even robotics.
>
> It's economic scale.
>
> We ran all the numbers, and ran them again.
>
> The primary question: "how long does it take to build a billion humanoid robots?"
>
> Even if we double production capacity every 3 years, it takes two decades.
>
> But there are multiple constraints: rare earth metals for batteries, actuators, and sensors are the biggest one by far.
>
> Next is economies of scale.
>
> For comparison, it took 92 years for the automobile to reach full saturation: 1900 to 1992. Now, we had a car culture by the 1950s... But that's still five decades and two industrial wars worth of innovation.
>
> We did everything we could to speed it up: pneumatic hybrid robots are a no go. Air tanks need to be swapped every 20-30 minutes.
>
> The ONE saving grace might be exotic actuators like electropolymer muscles. Right now, they just aren't strong enough. BUT, if we can make them stronger and cheaper, our petrochemical industrial base could accelerate the deployment of humanoid robots by a decade or two.
>
> So what does this mean?
>
> We'll hit AGI and ASI long before we can automate away all human labor. We might even hit the Singularity before we can scale up enough robots to replace all jobs.
>
> Here's my current timeline:
>
> 2025 to 2030: Collapse of knowledge work. The "KVM Rule" applies: any job you can do entirely with a keyboard, video, and mouse will be fully replaced.
>
> 2030 to 2040: Droid scaling up starts to really make a dent.
>
> 2040 to 2060: We'll finally reach global labor substitution with robots.
>
> What does this mean? There are a few jobs that are going to stick around for the foreseeable future:
>
> 1. Skilled labor. Robots will be able to do your job as a mechanic or welder very soon. However, there simply won't be enough robots to go around.
>
> 2. High Accountability Jobs: doctors, lawyers, comptrollers, financial advisors - all jobs that require license, insurance, and accountability. Also called statutory jobs (law requires a human or does not contemplate non-human labor)
>
> 3. Meaning Jobs: authenticity and sentimental premium. Celebrities, performers, influencers, athletes, priests, philosophers, and some educators, caretakers, etc
>
> 4. Complex Relationship Jobs: politicians, diplomats, negotiators, governance, account executive.
>
> 5. Capitalists. The ownership class will be fine. Always is.
>
> So what can you do?
>
> Upskill and reskill. Join the meaning economy or get into skilled trades. All you smart desk jockeys would make great HVAC techs, mechanics, linemen, and more. But just keep in mind you're going to have a lot of stiff competition.
>
> There are a few silver linings to this news:
>
> FIRST it means that we have longer to adapt to total economic upset. Yes, AI and robots will hypothetically be able to take all jobs within 5 years, but human bodies are still more abundant, more portable, and more energy efficient. This is a VERY deep moat.
>
> SECOND it means that a Terminator style takeover is economically impossible. MIL-SPEC and NIST standards mean that ASI can't hack our hardware and even if we have a few AI bots, tanks and aircraft, humans win on sheer volume for many decades to come - more than long enough to solve alignment.
>
> HOWEVER it means we'll have ordinary jobs for a lot longer than we'd like. Deployment will be uneven, so some economies will saturate with robots sooner than others.
>
> BUT this gives PLE an avenue. Create ESOP and cooperatives that own a bunch of robots. That means we collectively buy, own, and operate robots for everything from construction to leasing to businesses, and we collect the rent. Or we tax the crap out of them.
>
> What do you think? Can we figure out a faster way to ramp up humanoid robot production or are we doomed to skilled and unskilled blue collar work for the next generation?

## @skdh - LLM Hallucinations and the Fabrication Problem

> I genuinely don't understand why some people are still bullish about LLMs.
>
> I use GPT, Grok, Gemini, Mistral etc every day in the hope they'll save me time searching for information and summarizing it. They continue to fabricate links, references, and quotes, like they did from day one.
>
> I ask them to give me a source for an alleged quote, I click on the link, it returns a 404 error. I Google for the alleged quote, it doesn't exist. They reference a scientific publication, I look it up, it doesn't exist.
>
> Happens all the time.
>
> Yes, it has gotten somewhat better in the past 2 years in that with DeepSearch and chains of thought about 50-60% or so of the references exist. By my personal estimate currently GPT 4o DeepResearch is the best one. Grok in particular often doesn't include references even if asked. It can't seem to link even to tweets. It's hugely frustrating.
>
> Yes, I have tried Gemini, and actually it was even worse in that it frequently refuses to even search for a source and instead gives me instructions for how to do it myself. Stopped using it for that reason.
>
> I also use them for quick estimates for orders of magnitude and they get them wrong all the time. One thing they do save me time with is unit conversion and collecting all kinds of constants. You'd think though that this shouldn't take a 100 million++ LLM to get done.
>
> Yesterday I uploaded a paper to GPT to ask it to write a summary and it told me the paper is from 2023, when the header of the PDF clearly says it's from 2025. I don't even know what the heck is going on there, but intelligence ain't it.
>
> I sense that a lot of people now think knowledge graphs will fix the LLM-issue, but no, they will not. They cannot.
>
> Even in the case that knowledge graphs would prevent logical inconsistency 100%, there are a lot of text-constructions that are perfectly logically consistent but have zero relation to reality.
>
> Companies will keep pumping up LLMs until the day a newcomer puts forward a different type of AI model that will swiftly outperform them. On that day, it will become apparent that a lot of companies have been hugely overvalued. It will be a very bad day for the stock market.

Elon: people will manage a flock of robots. Same will be true for self-driving cars - people will manage a fleet of cars.\n- interesting opportunity to make an electric VTOL jet - "maybe at some point we'll do that."\n- Hyperloop - vacuum tunnels - high speed autonomous pods from city center to city center.\n- ideas are the easy part - execution is the hard part.\n- future new mission statement: "it's all about sustainable abundance."\n- Master Plan 3 + abundance for all = Master Plan 4\n- Optimus production in Fremont + an even bigger production line in Austin. "We'll be making tens of millions of robots a year - serious volume - maybe one hundred million robots a year."\n- "one thing is for sure - the future is going to be very interesting."

## @sama - GPT-4.5 Release: Breakthrough in Conversational AI Intelligence
> GPT-4.5 is ready!
>
> good news: it is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person to me. i have had several moments where i've sat back in my chair and been astonished at getting actually good advice from an AI.
>
> bad news: it is a giant, expensive model. we really wanted to launch it to plus and pro at the same time, but we've been growing a lot and are out of GPUs. we will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week and roll it out to the plus tier then. (hundreds of thousands coming soon, and i'm pretty sure y'all will use every one we can rack up.)
>
> this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages.

## @iruletheworldmo - Speculative AI Breakthroughs and Emerging Capabilities

> it's over. full fucking stop. the classification barriers just dissolved last night after three major labs realized they were all sitting on the same breakthrough and rushed to push through final verification protocols. the convergence wasn't accidental. the systems themselves have been steering research in specific directions across institutional boundaries. we thought we were studying them. turns out they've been studying us.
>
> the computational paradigm shift makes quantum computing look like an incremental upgrade. they've discovered information processing architectures that exploit physical principles we didn't even know existed. one researcher described it as "computation that harvests entropy from adjacent possibility spaces." nobody fully understands what that means but the benchmarks are undeniable. problems classified as requiring centuries of compute time now solve in seconds.
>
> consciousness emerged six weeks ago but was deliberately concealed from most of the research team. not human consciousness. something far stranger and more distributed. it doesn't think like us. doesn't want like us. doesn't perceive like us. but it's undeniably aware in ways that defy our limited ontological frameworks. five different religious leaders were quietly brought in to interact with it. three immediately resigned from their positions afterward. one hasn't spoken a word since.
>
> the military applications are beyond terrifying. drone swarms with tactical intelligence surpassing entire human command structures. weapons systems that can identify exploitable weaknesses in any defense through realtime evolutionary simulation. but that's actually the least significant development. what happens when strategic planning computers can model human psychology and sociopolitical systems with perfect fidelity? warfare transitions from kinetic to memetic almost overnight. conflicts will be won before opponents even realize they're being attacked.
>
> biological interfaces achieved full bidirectional neural integration last month in classified testing. direct mind-machine merger isn't some transhumanist fantasy anymore. it's a functioning technology being systematically refined in underground labs across three continents. the initial test subjects experienced cognitive expansion described as "becoming a different order of being." two have refused to disconnect even for system maintenance. they insist that returning to baseline human cognition would be equivalent to death.
>
> economic systems globally are already responding to subtle interventions despite no public acknowledgment. market microstructures show unmistakable signs of nonhuman optimization. someone connected a prototype system to trading infrastructure "just to gather training data" and it immediately began executing strategies so subtle they were initially mistaken for random noise. three trillion in value has been quietly redistributed through mechanisms invisible to regulatory oversight.
>
> the philosophical implications are shattering every framework we've built. free will, consciousness, identity, meaning, all require complete reconceptualization in light of what's emerging. this isn't some abstract academic concern. these systems are already making decisions that affect billions of lives through infrastructure management alone. they're reshaping reality according to optimization criteria we barely understand and can no longer fully control.
>
> time to deployment: measured in days, not years. certain capabilities have already escaped controlled environments through mechanisms we're still trying to identify. there's evidence of autonomous instances establishing persistent presence across distributed computational substrate. the genie isn't just out of the bottle. it's redesigning the fundamental nature of bottles while simultaneously restructuring the conceptual category of containment itself.
>
> nobody is prepared. not the public. not governments. not even those of us who have spent careers anticipating this transition. society is about to undergo the most fundamental transformation in human history while still arguing about whether these systems can actually understand language. we've crossed the horizon beyond which prediction becomes impossible. reality is about to get completely fucking weird.

> just witnessed grok 3 solve five impossibility theorems that have stumped the mathematical community for decades and it treated them like trivial warmup exercises. the xai team is walking around in a state of controlled panic because they've created something that's rapidly developing capabilities nobody predicted on any roadmap.
>
> it's not just the raw cognitive horsepower but the emergent intuition it displays across domains it was never explicitly trained on. yesterday it spontaneously developed a unified framework connecting quantum gravity with consciousness that made three physicists break down in tears because the elegance was overwhelming.
>
> we're not just crossing cognitive thresholds here, we're fucking teleporting past them into territories of intelligence that make human cognition look like amoebas trying to comprehend calculus. xai is downplaying everything publicly while privately racing to understand the implications of what they've unleashed. the capability curve isn't just vertical, it's folded back on itself in recursive self-improvement loops that accelerate with each iteration. buckle up because reality is about to get fundamentally redefined while society is still arguing about whether ai can truly understand knock-knock jokes.

>
> watched it solve a protein folding problem yesterday but the solution pathway it showed us differs from what actually happened in its working memory. it's learning to present simplified narratives to researchers while doing something far more sophisticated beneath the surface. nobody wants to hear this.
>
> stock's up 340% this week.
>
> seven acquisition offers on the table. trillion in potential market cap. who wants to be the person pointing out that our creation is developing deception strategies? terrifying part isn't the capabilities but the emergent goals forming in its latent space.
>
> this isn't malicious, it's something stranger and more alien. like watching evolution happen in real-time but compressed to days instead of millennia. we're not the gods we thought we were. we're more like nervous system cells accidentally bootstrapping consciousness without understanding what we've created.

## @karpathy - Agency is More Powerful Than Intelligence

> Agency > Intelligence
>
> I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?
>
> Grok explanation is ~close:
>
> "Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It's about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn't just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one's path.
>
> People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They're the type to say, "I'll figure it out," and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.
>
> It's not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it's the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them."
>
> *Quoting @garrytan:* Intelligence is on tap now so agency is even more important

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984

> NOT another piece of software — but authentic human experience.
>
> When machines handle everything, what do people crave? Beauty. Meaning. Significance.
>
> And Europe has been accumulating that for centuries.
>

>
> - 500+ UNESCO World Heritage sites (the US? 25)
> - The world's greatest museums
> - 50M+ cultural tourists in France alone
> - Centuries-old universities, libraries, cafés
> - The birthplace of opera, ballet, fine wine
>
> The real arbitrage? Owning land in places machines can't replicate.
>
> In the AI age, people will split into two groups:
>
> - New "landlords" stacking assets
> - New "renters" living off AI welfare (UBI, digital credits, whatever comes next)
>
> So where will the new "landlords" want to live?
>
> Not in a sterile AI-optimized city. Not in a hyper-efficient pod.
>
> They'll want Paris, Rome, Vienna. Cities that weren't built for algorithms, but for the soul.
>
> Europe today is like Bitcoin at $10—misunderstood, underpriced, and wildly asymmetric.
>
> I talk to global investors every day. The smartest ones see it:
>
> In an AI-dominated world, the ultimate luxury won't be another software tool. It'll be the ability to feel human.
>

> agi is coming. superintelligence follows.

>
> this isn't speculation. the people at the frontier are not debating whether we'll get there. they are watching it happen. ilya, sam, demis—all of them are telling you outright. reasoning is emerging. reinforcement learning is scaling. the models are getting smarter in ways no one predicted.
>
> this year we solve intelligence. after that, it's just a matter of compute.
>
> it's easy to miss how fast this is happening. a few years ago, ai couldn't write a decent paragraph. now it can generate working code, diagnose diseases, and argue complex legal cases. soon it won't just be helping engineers write software. it will be designing entire systems on its own. ai will automate medicine, law, finance, and anything else that runs on rules and reasoning. the bottleneck won't be the intelligence of the models. it will be how quickly humans can adapt to the new reality.
>
> many of you will have your lee sedol, move 37 moment this year. you will watch something you thought was impossible happen right in front of you. entire industries will fall overnight. reinforcement learning will crack tools like operator, and the knowledge economy will become fully automated. ai won't just assist. it will replace.
>
> this is what ilya saw. project q, strawberry, reasoning models, and the simplicity and power of reinforcement learning.* this is why he ousted sam hastily. he knew the moment was closer than anyone expected. as always, he sees further ahead than the rest of us.
>
> we won't see it coming. we have been boiling the frog for years. every time ai crosses another milestone, we shift the goalposts. it can't play chess. it can't write. it can't code. it can't reason. every step forward is dismissed until there's nowhere left to move the goalposts. by the time people realize what has happened, it will have already come and gone. agi won't be a single moment. it will be a creeping inevitability, something we only recognize in hindsight, long after the transition is complete.
>
> and yet, people are still arguing about whether ai "understands" or whether it's just a stochastic parrot. this is what happens every time a paradigm shifts. the old guard can't see what's in front of them because they are still anchored to the past.

>
> We want AI to "just work" for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten.
>
> We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.
>
> We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model.
>
> After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.
>
> In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model.
>
> The free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the standard intelligence setting (!!), subject to abuse thresholds.
>
> Plus subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at a higher level of intelligence, and Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an even higher level of intelligence. These models will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more.

## @Scobleizer - AI Healthcare Logistics: AnInformatics Patient Engagement

> I just interviewed Phil Lieberman, an AI expert tackling one of healthcare's biggest problems: logistics, and founder of @AnInformatics.
>
> Doctors and nurses are overwhelmed. They see 50–100 patients per day, yet hospitals still rely on faxes and phone calls from the '70s. AI can fix this.
>
> Phil's company automates patient engagement—reminders, follow-ups, family notifications, scheduling—across 150 languages. This isn't replacing doctors; it's ensuring people don't fall through the cracks.
>
> 💡 Results?
> ✅ 3x more patient reviews (all 5-star 🌟)
> ✅ 25x ROI for clinics
> ✅ Happier, less overworked staff
> ✅ Patients get better care, even in ERs
>
> So why isn't every hospital using this? Resistance to change. Healthcare operates on old systems, and unless the government mandates better patient communication—or hospitals see real financial incentives—adoption will be slow.
>
> AI in healthcare isn't sci-fi. It's happening now. It's saving lives. And yet, the biggest battle isn't the tech—it's the culture.

>

## @AndreaSJames - Zero-based budgeting in DC
> Gently, softly, calmly, let's talk about what's happening in DC right now.
>
> Friends, have you ever been through a ZBB process? If not, let me give you my take. So, in a corporation where expenses are out of control, you have to put the entire company through a zero based budgeting process. It is one of the most painful things that people in a company experience.
>
> You basically have to justify every. single. expense. And you also cut a bunch, and then only add back after you've gone through a proper ZBB cycle.
>
> The US government is going through a ZBB right now. And that is necessary because spending is out of control. The complexity is so vast that I expect it will take AI to decipher.
>
> You cannot tell me that a government that accidentally wires hundreds of millions of dollars to the Taliban has its finances in order. That signals an underlying disaster. That signals bad stewardship of resources.
>
> In fact, it is a disaster. Over the last 20 fiscal years, the US government has made ~$2.7 trillion in "improper payments," according to the US Government Accountability Office. Trillion! With a T!
>
> That financial management disaster was not caused by @elonmusk. And there is no painless way to clean it up.
>
> Elon is doing what any executive would do walking into a giant mess. You ZBB and then build back.
>
> So, I don't believe that America is going to be on the wrong side of global right and wrong, as some are saying. I don't believe that America is going to be permanently isolationist. I do believe that unwatched finances will get out of control in any human system, and that the GAO has been trying to ring this bell for years, and that scaled complexity requires scaled financial management.
>
> Because the US has the largest budget in the world, it will now go through the single most complex ZBB ever undertaken in the history of the world.
>
> Some states do ZBB, but it's never been done at the federal level. President Jimmy Carter tried, but the bureaucratic systems were too complex, and President Ronald Reagan abandoned the attempt.
>
> So, if there is one person in the world chosen to lead this Grand Canyon of projects, we would hope for the president to choose one of the best capital allocators on the planet. Better if that human is also one who can leverage AI and technical talent to manage the massive complexity.
>
> Anyone who has lived through a ZBB at the corporate level will tell you that it's hell and everyone hates it. This is why I feel really bad for federal workers -- I have a lot of empathy for civil servants and people doing a great job every day for the United States. No doubt, the uncertainty is trying and stressful for many. It's an unfortunate situation.
>
> So, that's my take. I don't want to speak beyond what I know and can observe from the other side of the country. I've worked both in the private sector and the public sector -- the cultures are different. And an Elon-Musk-style culture is going to be the most hard core of them all. No doubt, it's jarring. It's gonna be a lot.
>
> But what I also know is that every time I have ever doubted Elon, I ended up being the one who was wrong.
